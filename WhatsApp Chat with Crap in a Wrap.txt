25/03/2018, 21:37 - Tanveer: Halp
25/03/2018, 21:37 - Tanveer: Halp
25/03/2018, 21:37 - Tanveer: Halp
25/03/2018, 21:38 - Michael: Is this croissant distribution
25/03/2018, 21:38 - Eito Miyamura: Sry tanveer I haven't even touched that yet
25/03/2018, 21:38 - Michael: Lambda is 2 in question h?
25/03/2018, 21:38 - Michael: When’s this due
25/03/2018, 21:51 - Haytham: For h just cube the probability?
25/03/2018, 21:52 - Tanveer: I did that
25/03/2018, 21:52 - Tanveer: Ya
25/03/2018, 21:52 - Tanveer: _Ya_
25/03/2018, 21:52 - Tanveer: But for j if I were to do that, the number would be rly small
25/03/2018, 21:52 - Tanveer: Abnormally small
25/03/2018, 21:52 - Haytham: Yea for j you have to use a different λ
25/03/2018, 21:53 - Tanveer: Wb i ?
25/03/2018, 21:53 - Haytham: For i you can use the same method as h I think
25/03/2018, 21:54 - Haytham: But for j you need that the expected number of sightings in 4 months is  8
25/03/2018, 21:54 - Tanveer: Oke
25/03/2018, 21:54 - Tanveer: Ooooohhh
25/03/2018, 21:54 - Tanveer: Okk
25/03/2018, 21:54 - Haytham: And then u find out the probability of there being 12
25/03/2018, 21:54 - Tanveer: So that's kinda like question d to g in a way
25/03/2018, 21:54 - Haytham: I think so
25/03/2018, 21:55 - Haytham: Except that in d to g it’s not specified if the months are consecutive
25/03/2018, 21:55 - Tanveer: So with j
25/03/2018, 21:56 - Tanveer: I have λ as 8
25/03/2018, 21:56 - Tanveer: P(X = 12)
25/03/2018, 21:56 - Haytham: Yes
25/03/2018, 21:56 - Tanveer: And that's it?
25/03/2018, 21:56 - Haytham: I think
25/03/2018, 21:56 - Tanveer: Okayy thanks my duud
25/03/2018, 21:57 - Tanveer: I'll do k onwards some other day

Putin from different years. Just look how they are different. Basically Russia is ran by clones
30/03/2018, 01:23 - Dimitri: Basically real Putin is dead and now country is ran by puppet masters who rule it through the clone
30/03/2018, 01:26 - Dimitri: It explains a lot about how he went from someone who actually tried to get country out of shithole to someone who spoils all international relationships and declares meaningless wars
30/03/2018, 01:27 - Dimitri: Most probably Russia is not even controlled by Russians at that point
30/03/2018, 01:28 - Dimitri: But by behind the scenes reptiloid puppet masters who control everything

14/04/2018, 12:05 - Tanveer: I think it'll be fine after we finish exam week to do something lit ygm
14/04/2018, 14:07 - Pablo Dent: Does anyone know of a way to do ```if list contains(anything except x or y)``` in python?
14/04/2018, 14:16 - Sian: U could iterate though and see if any of the elements are x or y
14/04/2018, 14:17 - Pablo Dent: Yeah it just feels like there should be a function or method for it
14/04/2018, 14:31 - Manuj: The only way I can think of is ```if set(list).union(x,y) ! = set([x, y])```
14/04/2018, 14:31 - Pablo Dent: I feel like that's less efficient
14/04/2018, 14:32 - Manuj: Oh wait
14/04/2018, 14:32 - Pablo Dent: Also on the unit 1 exam it tells you to use ```TestMessage.txt```, Does anyone know how to get that?
14/04/2018, 14:33 - Manuj: Idk abt that
14/04/2018, 14:33 - Manuj: But for ur last question
14/04/2018, 14:33 - Manuj: U cld do
14/04/2018, 14:34 - Manuj: If all(i == x or i ==y for i in list) :
14/04/2018, 14:34 - Pablo Dent: ooh
14/04/2018, 14:34 - Manuj: Put a not before the all
14/04/2018, 14:35 - Manuj: If not all(i == x or i ==y for i in list) :
14/04/2018, 14:35 - Manuj: Is what I meant
14/04/2018, 14:35 - Pablo Dent: that's nice
14/04/2018, 14:35 - Pablo Dent: thx
14/04/2018, 14:35 - Manuj: Np
14/04/2018, 15:14 - Pablo Dent: wtf has anyone done q7
14/04/2018, 15:15 - Manuj: I've done all of them but I don't have my laptop rn. Which one is it?
14/04/2018, 15:16 - Pablo Dent: adding 1 5 and 7 to the morse code
14/04/2018, 15:18 - Manuj: For decode u use the tree in the preliminary notes to figure out where those characters wld fit in the tree and edit the dash, letter and dot lists as needed
14/04/2018, 15:19 - Manuj: For encode u just add the relevant morse code characters to the list with the morse code
14/04/2018, 15:19 - Manuj: Idk if that's helpful I don't have much skeleton code on me
14/04/2018, 15:19 - Manuj: *my
14/04/2018, 15:19 - Pablo Dent: It decoded it differently tho
14/04/2018, 15:20 - Manuj: Oh
14/04/2018, 15:20 - Pablo Dent: because 1 5 and 7 are in a weird place in the ascii table
14/04/2018, 15:21 - Manuj: U have to add elif statements in gettransmission to make Index have the right value for those characters
14/04/2018, 15:21 - Pablo Dent: oh
14/04/2018, 15:22 - Manuj: Yh I remember having the same problem
14/04/2018, 15:35 - Pablo Dent: When you get an error in the python debugging program trying to find an error in your python program
14/04/2018, 15:41 - Manuj: 😂😂
14/04/2018, 15:53 - Tanveer: So like
14/04/2018, 15:53 - Tanveer: You can use other subroutines

14/04/2018, 23:48 - Manuj: Dw I was just as weirded out as the first time
15/04/2018, 12:17 - Pablo Dent: Is there a way to catch errors in one branch of an if-elif-else block?
15/04/2018, 12:20 - Eito Miyamura: Put the try except block inside that branch?
15/04/2018, 12:21 - Pablo Dent: i want to catch an error in the condition tho
15/04/2018, 12:21 - Eito Miyamura: Ah then you can assign the result of the condition to a boolean variable
15/04/2018, 12:21 - Eito Miyamura: And then error catch that assignment
15/04/2018, 12:22 - Pablo Dent: ohh before the block?
15/04/2018, 12:22 - Eito Miyamura: Yea
15/04/2018, 12:22 - Pablo Dent: clever
15/04/2018, 12:22 - Eito Miyamura: And use the boolean variable in the if statements
15/04/2018, 12:25 - Pablo Dent: yeah thanks

22/08/2018, 07:26 - Daniel Batchford: So there's a chick in my class I like; unfrotunately im quiet, calculated and intelligent and she likes big dumb jocks. So anyway one day me and her boyfriend are walking among a group of our felow students when a gang banger appears and threatens with a gun. Her 'big and though' boyfriend instantly freezes and loses the ability to speak. I on the other hand squint my eyes and step forward pulling my katana for judo practise out in one fell swoop. "Go ahead" I say. The gun is only 400 years old while the sword is the child of many millenia. Do you fancy the odds?" Instantly the gang-banger drops his weapon and runs. My other classmates cheer while her jock boyfriend pretends the whole thing was funny. She looks at me and sees what she didnt see before. She thanks me with a kiss, but I don't smile because I was only doing my duty. Safe to say she saw who a real man was that day. I may be quiet and collected, but raise a weapon against me and youll face your worst nightmare
22/08/2018, 08:40 - Pablo Dent: Good meme yes very good meme the meme is incredible it's the best meme awesome meme mhm yes I like this meme it's a not bad meme it's really good yes not bad very cool meme that is funny meme

17/09/2018, 08:43 - Daniel Batchford: Why comment such absolute low tier joke that has already been made? I think some people are just not as sentient as others, and you're a pod. There's nothing going on in that brain of yours. You have no soul. You're an automatron. I want to experiment on you to see what else prefabricated comes out of that robotic ant brain of yours. I've just outed you as less than human. I dare you to say something original that you came up with on your own, robot. "Beep-boop beep-boop, I'm a fucking robot, I say whatever the fuck comes into my mind," that's you. You intrigue me, automatron. But I pity your existence.

17/09/2018, 08:44 - Daniel Batchford: You fool. You absolute buffoon. You think you can challenge me in my own realm? You think you can rebel against my authority? You dare come into my home and upturn my dining chairs and spill coffee grounds in my Keurig? You thought you were safe in your chain mail armor behind that screen of yours. I will take these laminate wood floor boards and destroy you. I didn't want war. But I didn't start it.

Everyone thinks you're just a fucking disgrace to this place, you stupid cunt. If you keep doing this shit then you will be fucking dead, you'll be fucking cut to pieces, you'll be DESTROYED, you got that you little shit? Try to make a "clever" joke like that to me or anyone else on here ever again, and you won't see tomorrow. You'll just see my face, with your blood on it, while I'm beating you to a fucking PULP. You're gonna fucking DIE if I ever see you open your little smart ass mouth ever again, then you will be wiped from the face of the fucking earth. K?

19/10/2018, 09:15 - Tanveer: Why comment such absolute low tier joke that has already been made? I think some people are just not as sentient as others, and you're a pod. There's nothing going on in that brain of yours. You have no soul. You're an automatron. I want to experiment on you to see what else prefabricated comes out of that robotic ant brain of yours. I've just outed you as less than human. I dare you to say something original that you came up with on your own, robot. "Beep-boop beep-boop, I'm a fucking robot, I say whatever the fuck comes into my mind," that's you. You intrigue me, automatron. But I pity your existence.

I fucking dare you, say that to me again, say that to me one more fucking time. I swear to god I'll fucking kill you with my bare hands. Please, just shut up, nobody likes to fucking hear you. Everyone thinks you're just a fucking disgrace to this place, you stupid cunt. If you keep doing this shit then you will be fucking dead, you'll be fucking cut to pieces, you'll be DESTROYED, you got that you little shit? Try to make a "clever" joke like that to me or anyone else on here ever again, and you won't see tomorrow. You'll just see my face, with your blood on it, while I'm beating you to a fucking PULP. You're gonna fucking DIE if I ever see you open your little smart ass mouth ever again, then you will be wiped from the face of the fucking earth. K?

22/10/2018, 00:00 - Catherine: But green park is far from Hyde park?
22/10/2018, 00:00 - Tanveer: Not rly
22/10/2018, 00:00 - Catherine: Is it not?
22/10/2018, 00:01 - Michael: It’s like a 15 min walk
22/10/2018, 00:01 - Tanveer: But you do raise a point
22/10/2018, 00:01 - Tanveer: Why not Hyde Park Corner? Or the other stations
22/10/2018, 00:01 - Tanveer: Knightsbridge
22/10/2018, 00:01 - Pablo Dent: We can just meet at Hyde park
22/10/2018, 00:02 - Pablo Dent: Like in the park
22/10/2018, 00:02 - Pablo Dent: In the place we always go
22/10/2018, 00:59 - +44 7505 968677: I'm getting fudging confused with Hyde park and green park

22/10/2018, 01:00 - Tanveer: Who's others
22/10/2018, 01:00 - +44 7505 968677: So we can meet probably at Hyde park corner station

22/10/2018, 09:23 - +44 7505 968677: Well some of us can meet early I guess
22/10/2018, 09:23 - +44 7505 968677: We could push it back to 5
22/10/2018, 09:24 - Bence: Sounds good to me
22/10/2018, 09:24 - +44 7505 968677: Because I will be in kings cross by 4pm
22/10/2018, 09:25 - +44 7505 968677: So we can meet up at the station at 5pm and whoever was planting to get there at 6 can just meet us in the park I guess,but I might be one of those people who arrives at 6
22/10/2018, 09:25 - +44 7505 968677: Also if anyone's up for a walk to primrose hill you will make Eito very happy

03/11/2018, 16:34 - Tanveer: <Media omitted>
03/11/2018, 16:36 - Haytham: I think it’s  already an exact derivative
03/11/2018, 16:36 - Haytham: d/dx(-ycosx)
03/11/2018, 16:36 - Haytham: Wait no
03/11/2018, 16:36 - Haytham: I’m rarted
03/11/2018, 16:39 - Haytham: looks like it could be the quotient rule
03/11/2018, 16:43 - Tanveer: wait wat
03/11/2018, 16:44 - Tanveer: what over what
03/11/2018, 16:46 - Haytham: The denominator isn’t in there but it looks a bit like d/dx(y/sinx)
03/11/2018, 16:48 - Haytham: Which gives u LHS but over sin^2 x and u can use double angle on  RHS and it should work out
03/11/2018, 17:02 - Tanveer: Wait so (d/dx(y/sinx))/sin(2x) = sin(x)
03/11/2018, 17:02 - Tanveer: then what
03/11/2018, 17:07 - Tanveer: And how do you do b 😭
03/11/2018, 17:16 - Haytham: You get that d/dx(y/sinx)=2cosx
03/11/2018, 17:17 - Tanveer: why 2cosx
03/11/2018, 17:17 - Tanveer: 2cosx = sin2xsinx ?
03/11/2018, 17:18 - Haytham: The RHS is 2sin^2x cosx
03/11/2018, 17:25 - Tanveer: Yes I agree
03/11/2018, 17:28 - Haytham: Then divide thihhh by sin^2 x and u get the LHS as the exact derivative of y/sinx
03/11/2018, 17:41 - Tanveer: Ah
03/11/2018, 17:41 - Tanveer: Ly
03/11/2018, 17:41 - Tanveer: What about 🅱
03/11/2018, 17:46 - Michael: I think it is but it’s d/dx(ysinx)
03/11/2018, 17:46 - Michael: I think
03/11/2018, 17:47 - Michael: Nvm ignore that

T=2π√(l/g)
In this equation, l is the length of the string from the point of swing to the centre of mass of the pendulum. The two variables I would therefore explore w

19/12/2018, 23:29 - Manuj: As in Ram and Sita
19/12/2018, 23:36 - Michael: there are, indeed, only two possible outcomes:
either a surgical, precise hit, or a ridiculous, laughable miss.
however, based in my observations, i believe the chances of the second option turning out to be true are fairly low, dare i say are negligible, if not absolutely nil.
you affirm that you have a romantic companion who identifies as a man, am i correct? well, in that case, i could safely place a bet on the fact that he doesn't so often, if at all perform mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-cheek contact for recreational purposes with you. if such a bet was placed, i would most certainly win it.
overly loud and exaggerated noises of the kind of physical contact i described before.
i can also affirm with a good certainty that this said "boyfriend" shall, in the future, cease his current search for anorther romantic companion other than you. when such a thing happens, he will settle with her, abandoning you. he is also not going to miss you a bit.
i also predict that he will do the so-called "skrrt", which is no more than the sound of a vehicle's engine and tires running at full throttle, but still before such vehicle catches momentum.
he is, finally, going to perform the head and arms movement popularly known as "dab", in the exact precise ways that the DJ known as "Wiz Khalifa" so often does that it became a personal trait.

05/01/2019, 18:24 - Pablo Dent: ¿Qué diablos acabas de decir de mí, pequeña perra? Sabré que me gradué de mi rango naval, participé en muchas incursiones secretas en al Qaeda y tengo más de 300 asesinatos confirmados. Me entrené en la guerra de los gorilas y soy el francotirador más alto de todas las fuerzas armadas estadounidenses. No eres nada para mí, sino sólo otro objetivo. Te maldeciré con la precisión que nunca antes se ha visto en esta tierra, marca mis malditas palabras. ¿Crees que puedes salirse con la suya diciéndome esta mierda en línea? Piensa otra vez, en silencio cuando hablamos, llamo a mi compañía secreta de espías en todo EE. UU. Y tu dirección IP está siendo rastreada ahora, para que puedas prepararte mejor para la tormenta. La tormenta que destruye lo patético que llamas tu vida. Estás muerto, muchacho, puedo estar en cualquier lugar, en cualquier momento, y puedo matarte de más de setecientas formas, y eso es solo con mi mano desnuda. No solo estoy ampliamente entrenado en combate desarmado, sino que tengo acceso completo al arsenal del Cuerpo de Marines de los EE. UU. Y lo utilizaré al máximo para eliminar tu miserable trasero del continente. Si supiera lo que era una retribución inaceptable, su pequeño comentario "inteligente" estaba a punto de caer sobre usted, tal vez estaría cargando su maldita lengua. Pero no pudiste, no lo hiciste, y ahora pagas el precio, maldito estúpido. Voy a cagar mierda sobre ti, y la hundiré. Te mueres (kido)

30/01/2019, 21:19 - Michael: _What a funny tradition! Bulgarian children simply throw their tooth on the roof of their house. And when they throw the tooth, they say: “На ти Вранке костен зъб, дай ми железен” which means “Great Raven, I give you my bone tooth, give me an iron tooth!” Throwing up the tooth is actually a symbol of walking up, progress, good future and prosperity… ¨Give me an iron tooth¨ means here that the children wish not to have problems with his/her new tooth, that it shall be strong like iron. But children’s in Bulgaria are not given money or candy in exchange… What a selfish raven!_

10/02/2019, 09:49 - Mark: Whats the question thi
10/02/2019, 09:49 - Tanveer: Nono thats volume (relating to how far up, etc)
10/02/2019, 09:50 - Tanveer: its a PAG

10/02/2019, 09:50 - Tanveer: STupid pag
10/02/2019, 09:55 - Michael: I did volume/length for some of these and they gave roughly the same answer, which i reckon is the cross sectional area
10/02/2019, 09:55 - Michael: So the lengths are probs something like this
10/02/2019, 09:55 - Pablo Dent: Ohh wait right this makes sense
10/02/2019, 09:55 - Pablo Dent: For pressure
10/02/2019, 09:56 - Pablo Dent: We just measured the syringe to calculate the area
10/02/2019, 09:56 - Eito Miyamura: Wait if this is the one where you lift weights it's how far the syringe went up and then you can work out work done
10/02/2019, 09:56 - Michael: Oui oui
10/02/2019, 09:56 - Pablo Dent: We didn't use weights
10/02/2019, 09:56 - Pablo Dent: But yea
10/02/2019, 10:00 - Tanveer: So you find work done
10/02/2019, 10:00 - Tanveer: By measuring volume over length

06/04/2019, 22:06 - Tanveer: I mean it's also the (chain or product, idk which one) rule
06/04/2019, 22:06 - Haytham: Chain
06/04/2019, 22:06 - Tanveer: Cuz it can be rewritten as 2(9+x^2)^-2
06/04/2019, 22:06 - Pablo Dent: oh
06/04/2019, 22:06 - Pablo Dent: yeah true
06/04/2019, 22:07 - Mark: Numberator xd
06/04/2019, 22:07 - Haytham: The derivative of the stuff in the bracket goes on top
06/04/2019, 22:07 - Mark: Thats pretty good mistype
06/04/2019, 22:07 - Tanveer: Will it be - 8x at the top then?
06/04/2019, 22:07 - Pablo Dent: i mean d/dx 2f(x) = 2f'x so dont think it matter
06/04/2019, 22:07 - Haytham: Yes
06/04/2019, 22:08 - Tanveer: Ahh good ty
06/04/2019, 22:08 - Tanveer: One more thing
06/04/2019, 22:08 - Mark: Tangay
06/04/2019, 22:08 - Haytham: Split it
06/04/2019, 22:08 - Haytham: Subtract 4 from the top then add it again
06/04/2019, 22:08 - Mark: By parts?
06/04/2019, 22:09 - Mark: Oooh
06/04/2019, 22:09 - Mark: Thats smart haytham
06/04/2019, 22:09 - Tanveer: Wait, why 4
06/04/2019, 22:09 - Michael: ^^
06/04/2019, 22:09 - Michael: Cuz u can take a factor of 2 out
06/04/2019, 22:09 - Tanveer: Okk
06/04/2019, 22:09 - Tanveer: And then
06/04/2019, 22:09 - Tanveer: Uh
06/04/2019, 22:09 - Haytham: You’ll see
06/04/2019, 22:09 - Haytham: The details are left as an exercise
06/04/2019, 22:09 - Mark: The proof is left to the reader
06/04/2019, 22:10 - Pablo Dent: cos its my favourite number
06/04/2019, 22:10 - Haytham changed the subject from "🥖 sBaguetti 🥖" to "🥖 Mom’s sBaguetti 🥖"
06/04/2019, 22:10 - Tanveer: I'm gonna deny that I laughed at that
06/04/2019, 22:10 - Tanveer: Because its SHIT
06/04/2019, 22:10 - Tanveer: Tanku
06/04/2019, 22:10 - Haytham: 2x-4=2(x-2)
07/04/2019, 19:21 - Tanveer: <Media omitted>
07/04/2019, 19:25 - Michael: ii is binomial I think
07/04/2019, 19:27 - Tanveer: Yeah, I did that
07/04/2019, 19:27 - Tanveer: Y ~ B(10, 0.88)
07/04/2019, 19:28 - Michael: Oh yeah you crossed that out
07/04/2019, 19:28 - Tanveer: P(X ≥ 9) = 1 - P(X ≤ 8)
07/04/2019, 19:28 - Michael: Yeah
07/04/2019, 19:28 - Tanveer: = 0.7700
07/04/2019, 19:28 - Tanveer: Which is wrong
07/04/2019, 19:29 - Michael: What was the answer?
07/04/2019, 19:29 - Tanveer: It should be 0.6583
07/04/2019, 19:29 - Tanveer: Hol up
07/04/2019, 19:30 - Tanveer: No i got this
07/04/2019, 19:30 - Tanveer: Calc error before then
07/04/2019, 19:30 - Tanveer: iii is confusing me
07/04/2019, 19:30 - Pablo Dent: <Media omitted>
07/04/2019, 19:31 - Tanveer: 😂 Shut up
07/04/2019, 19:31 - Pablo Dent: surely should be the same thing?
07/04/2019, 19:31 - Pablo Dent: but it 5 marks
07/04/2019, 19:31 - Tanveer: It isn'tt
07/04/2019, 19:31 - Tanveer: The mark scheme says some confusing shit
07/04/2019, 19:31 - Michael: What was the answer on the mark scheme
07/04/2019, 19:32 - Tanveer: <Media omitted>
07/04/2019, 19:32 - Tanveer: Why is it normal
07/04/2019, 19:32 - Tanveer: Tfffff
07/04/2019, 19:32 - Pablo Dent: normal approximates binomial
07/04/2019, 19:32 - Pablo Dent: or more like the other way round
07/04/2019, 19:32 - Tanveer: When was this a thing
07/04/2019, 19:32 - Tanveer: Wut
07/04/2019, 19:33 - Haytham: It just be like that
07/04/2019, 19:33 - Tanveer: Okay, fine
07/04/2019, 19:33 - Haytham: Poisson approximates normal too
07/04/2019, 19:33 - Haytham: They’re cousins
07/04/2019, 19:33 - Tanveer: But then why is it N(88, 10.56) and not N(100, 0.88) ?
07/04/2019, 19:34 - Tanveer: Or P(0.88) or smth?
07/04/2019, 19:35 - Tanveer: Ohh in normal you know the mean is 88
07/04/2019, 19:36 - Tanveer: Okay, the 10.56 has to the the variance
07/04/2019, 19:36 - Haytham: Because on average there will be 88 with >500
07/04/2019, 19:36 - Haytham: Yes
07/04/2019, 19:36 - Tanveer: But how do you find that out from binomial stuff
07/04/2019, 19:36 - Tanveer: It's npq
07/04/2019, 19:37 - Haytham: I don’t think binomial is useful
07/04/2019, 19:37 - Haytham: I think the suitable approximation we’ve made is using 88 as the mean
07/04/2019, 19:37 - Tanveer: But what do you use as the variance for the normal distribution then
07/04/2019, 19:39 - Haytham: wait never mind the variance is the variance of the bin dist it is useful that’s why
07/04/2019, 19:39 - Haytham: Yea I was wrong there
07/04/2019, 19:39 - Tanveer: Boom
07/04/2019, 19:39 - Tanveer: Thank you guys
07/04/2019, 19:39 - Tanveer: Very cool!
07/04/2019, 19:39 - Haytham: npq gang 😎
07/04/2019, 19:39 - Tanveer: Ahh I rly love doing my npq on the safety of Formula 22 🛫🛫🤣🧠
07/04/2019, 19:40 - Pablo Dent: npq is the new n word
07/04/2019, 19:40 - Pablo Dent: we cannot say anymore
07/04/2019, 19:40 - Haytham: np(1-p)
07/04/2019, 19:40 - Pablo Dent: NOPE NOT ALLOWED DONT EVEN TRY
07/04/2019, 22:36 - Mark: npq
07/04/2019, 23:15 - Reemon Spector: Big sad
07/04/2019, 23:17 - Pablo Dent: Oof

07/04/2019, 23:17 - Reemon Spector: I actual used these on Saturday 😂
07/04/2019, 23:18 - Pablo Dent: Im guessing you just used UFD property of integers
07/04/2019, 23:18 - Reemon Spector: Well
07/04/2019, 23:18 - Reemon Spector: Shh
07/04/2019, 23:18 - Reemon Spector: Zip it

07/04/2019, 23:23 - Pablo Dent: If you liked it then you should have put a _triple consisting of a set and two operations, consistent with the group axioms for the first operation and the laws of distributivity for the second,_ on it
07/04/2019, 23:27 - Bence: Addition has to form a commutative group you amateur
07/04/2019, 23:29 - Haytham: *Winnie the Pooh meme*
Commutative group 
Abelian group 
Also works with drake format,  expanding brain format etc but those formats are left to the memer

08/04/2019, 15:57 - Michael: Is the critical value A the value for which P(x<=A) is the largest probability that’s under the sig level, or is it the value for which P(x<=A) is the probability that’s nearest to the sig level
08/04/2019, 15:58 - Michael: For bin hypothesis test
08/04/2019, 17:05 - Eito Miyamura: The smallest probability that its over the sig level I think
08/04/2019, 17:06 - Sian: Under not over
08/04/2019, 17:07 - Tanveer: Oui
08/04/2019, 17:07 - Eito Miyamura: I thought critical value was the first value where its in the uh oh zone
08/04/2019, 17:07 - Tanveer: Was this sent from Tabs's
08/04/2019, 17:07 - Sian: So sig level 5% if P(X<=A) = 0.0499 and P(X<=A+1) = 0.0501 then critical region is X<=A
08/04/2019, 17:09 - Eito Miyamura: Ye
08/04/2019, 17:09 - Eito Miyamura: So like A+1 is in the uh oh zone
08/04/2019, 17:10 - Sian: No it irrelevant
08/04/2019, 17:10 - Sian: U dont care bout it
08/04/2019, 17:17 - Eito Miyamura: Fairs
08/04/2019, 17:18 - Eito Miyamura: I guess I need to do a bit more on stats xd
08/04/2019, 17:35 - Manuj: It's cos there's a less than 5% chance of A happening but a more than 5% chance of A+1 happening
08/04/2019, 17:36 - Manuj: So A is in the uh oh zone and A+1 isn't

12/04/2019, 21:15 - Haytham: cross product with 2 gives you the area of the parallelogram formed by them and  the triangle formed by them will have half the area of the parallelogram
12/04/2019, 21:15 - Haytham: I think you can use that fact I haven’t done the question tho
12/04/2019, 21:17 - Tanveer: Holy fuck damn that's pretty cool
12/04/2019, 21:17 - Tanveer: Oh wait
12/04/2019, 21:17 - Tanveer: I don't know how I got 25.6
12/04/2019, 21:17 - Tanveer: I think I should've got 24.6
12/04/2019, 21:17 - Tanveer: Because half of that is the answer
12/04/2019, 21:17 - Pablo Dent: calc error
12/04/2019, 21:17 - Tanveer: And the area is  ½absin(θ)
12/04/2019, 21:18 - Tanveer: I didn't do ½
12/04/2019, 21:18 - Tanveer: Ty ty
12/04/2019, 21:20 - Haytham: This is supposed to say modulus of cross product

13/04/2019, 13:00 - Tanveer: I cant do this
13/04/2019, 13:00 - Tanveer: I've tried so long
13/04/2019, 13:03 - Sian: 3^5+2
13/04/2019, 13:03 - Sian: =245
13/04/2019, 13:03 - Tanveer: Yes thank you but how do u disprove it
13/04/2019, 13:03 - Sian: 245 not prime done
13/04/2019, 13:03 - Tanveer: You can't just say when n = 5 it's not
13/04/2019, 13:03 - Pablo Dent: yep
13/04/2019, 13:03 - Pablo Dent: you kinda can
13/04/2019, 13:04 - Sian: Yh u plug in 3^(5)+2
13/04/2019, 13:04 - Sian: Say that equals 245
13/04/2019, 13:04 - Tanveer: Tf then why can't you do that for every proof 🤔
13/04/2019, 13:04 - Sian: 245/5=49
13/04/2019, 13:04 - Pablo Dent: you can
13/04/2019, 13:04 - Sian: Therefore not prime
13/04/2019, 13:04 - Pablo Dent: finding a counter example
13/04/2019, 13:05 - Pablo Dent: the statement is basically saying '3^1+2 is prime' *and* '3^2+2 is prime' *and* ...
13/04/2019, 13:05 - Pablo Dent: only one of those statements needs to be false to falsify the whole statement

15/04/2019, 19:18 - Tanveer: From there
15/04/2019, 19:19 - Tanveer: Do u have to do partial fraction

15/04/2019, 19:19 - Michael: Partial fractions
15/04/2019, 19:19 - Michael: So u can integrate both sides

16/04/2019, 11:28 - Tanveer: Erm
16/04/2019, 11:39 - Eito Miyamura: When it says x and y
16/04/2019, 11:39 - Eito Miyamura: It means like distance from origin to left or up
16/04/2019, 11:40 - Eito Miyamura: And so you use the far that x=rcosθ, y=rsinθ
16/04/2019, 11:40 - Eito Miyamura: And you're given the expression for r
16/04/2019, 11:42 - Tanveer: When dx/dθ = 0, what does that mean?
16/04/2019, 11:43 - Tanveer: And how do you know it's ¼π and not ½π?
16/04/2019, 11:43 - Tanveer: Or 0?
16/04/2019, 11:50 - Eito Miyamura: It's a minimum point
16/04/2019, 11:51 - Eito Miyamura: You kinda have to figure it out by using trig identities or plotting point
16/04/2019, 11:51 - Eito Miyamura: Max* but you can't tell generally
16/04/2019, 11:51 - Eito Miyamura: Cuz if you plug it in you get 0
16/04/2019, 11:57 - Tanveer: Fair enough
16/04/2019, 11:57 - Tanveer: Okk
16/04/2019, 11:57 - Tanveer: I kinda get it

16/04/2019, 12:50 - Tanveer: <Media omitted>
16/04/2019, 12:51 - Tanveer: Basically to sum it up I hate core pure
16/04/2019, 12:59 - Eito Miyamura: I think it gets you to integrate a sinhx
16/04/2019, 12:59 - Eito Miyamura: SinhU
16/04/2019, 12:59 - Eito Miyamura: And then sub
16/04/2019, 13:00 - Eito Miyamura: By doing the dx = duk (coshu)
16/04/2019, 13:00 - Eito Miyamura: Or smth like that
16/04/2019, 13:04 - Tanveer: It makes the integral more complicated tho
16/04/2019, 15:18 - Tanveer: I hate roots of unity and recurrence relations
16/04/2019, 15:20 - Pablo Dent: Roots of unity are just e^i2πk/n

17/04/2019, 12:56 - Tanveer: <Media omitted>
17/04/2019, 13:27 - Eito Miyamura: You do the int(πy^2) dx thing but with y being the difference of the 2 functions

17/04/2019, 13:28 - Tanveer: ty
17/04/2019, 13:37 - Bence: I meant that the way you deal with recurrence relations is the exact same as what you do with DEs

18/04/2019, 16:38 - Tanveer: So we have O
18/04/2019, 16:38 - Tanveer: How do we calculate expected
18/04/2019, 16:38 - Sian: The weird columny thing
18/04/2019, 16:38 - Tanveer: ?
18/04/2019, 16:38 - Tanveer: Uhh
18/04/2019, 16:39 - Sian: U use the totals from the row and column and do something
18/04/2019, 16:39 - Tanveer: Do smth
18/04/2019, 16:39 - Tanveer: Uh OK
18/04/2019, 16:47 - Manuj: (total of row x total of column)/ total of everything

18/04/2019, 17:18 - Haytham: Yea what does it even mean
18/04/2019, 18:11 - Eito Miyamura: I took it as
18/04/2019, 18:12 - Eito Miyamura: You take 5 numbers where parts of the digits are in the range of 0-26 and then use those as indexes?
18/04/2019, 18:12 - Eito Miyamura: Or multiply 26 by those numbers to get indexes alternatively
18/04/2019, 18:12 - Sian: I just multiplied by 100 and mod26 the nums
18/04/2019, 18:12 - Pablo Dent: ye me too
18/04/2019, 18:13 - Eito Miyamura: How do you mod 26 16.3?
18/04/2019, 18:13 - Sian: You can get the letters however u want as long as u show how u did it
18/04/2019, 18:13 - Tanveer: Wdym mod 26 them?
18/04/2019, 18:13 - Eito Miyamura: Nvm I'm dumb
18/04/2019, 18:13 - Sian: 1000 i meant
18/04/2019, 18:13 - Pablo Dent: 163 idiot
18/04/2019, 18:13 - Haytham: Thanks for the theorem, Eito
18/04/2019, 18:13 - Eito Miyamura: Remainder 26
18/04/2019, 18:13 - Tanveer: Ohhh

30/05/2019, 12:47 - Eito Miyamura: Write an English essay for STEP
30/05/2019, 12:54 - Tanveer: I guess you'll still be surrounded by these memes
30/05/2019, 14:21 - Manuj: If I did, would they be legally obliged to read it all in case there's some valid maths at the end?
30/05/2019, 19:26 - Eito Miyamura: Or do the maths but in English
30/05/2019, 19:26 - Eito Miyamura: So write "solve eks squared plus five eks plus six equals zero"
30/05/2019, 19:27 - Pablo Dent: You know how x is an actual thing
30/05/2019, 19:27 - Haytham: eks dee
30/05/2019, 20:24 - Eito Miyamura: Hey look I was tipsy when I wrote this

31/05/2019, 00:32 - Michael: Works for me
31/05/2019, 00:36 - Tanveer: Stories?
31/05/2019, 00:36 - Michael: Yeah
01/06/2019, 21:24 - Tanveer: <Media omitted>
01/06/2019, 21:46 - Manuj: <Media omitted>
01/06/2019, 21:48 - Manuj: Haven't done this question but I'm guessing you have to get your expression from part iii, set it to 0, and solve for k
01/06/2019, 22:38 - Tanveer: HAHAHAHA
01/06/2019, 22:38 - Tanveer: Ffs Sahaj 😂😂
01/06/2019, 22:38 - Tanveer: I did find two values for k, but now I just need to find the points and have no idea going about that
02/06/2019, 13:31 - Nick: Where is this on SharePoint?
02/06/2019, 13:52 - Nick: You set the eqn you got in the previous part to 0 and then find k
02/06/2019, 13:53 - Nick: I think the date is wrong tho can't find the ms
02/06/2019, 13:55 - Tanveer: Yeah the date is wrong
02/06/2019, 13:55 - Nick: Do you know where it is?
02/06/2019, 13:55 - Tanveer: It's in the burdett A2 core Pure
02/06/2019, 13:56 - Nick: Ah ty
02/06/2019, 13:57 - Nick: Ah its 06
02/06/2019, 13:58 - Tanveer: 2006?
02/06/2019, 13:59 - Nick: http://mei.org.uk/files/papers/fp306ju_9ne5.pdf
02/06/2019, 16:07 - Tanveer: Ayy ty ty
02/06/2019, 17:42 - Tanveer: <Media omitted>
02/06/2019, 17:49 - Nick: why did u take out 1/3 not 1/9
02/06/2019, 17:54 - Tanveer: <Media omitted>
02/06/2019, 17:55 - Tabs: But you need x^2 on it’s own
02/06/2019, 17:55 - Sian: Coz if u pull out a third u get (sqrt3x)^2 and a = sqrt3
02/06/2019, 17:55 - Tabs: So you take out the 9th
02/06/2019, 17:56 - Tanveer: Ffffffff
02/06/2019, 17:56 - Tanveer: AAAHHH
02/06/2019, 17:56 - Tanveer: Why am I like this before core Pure I stg
02/06/2019, 17:56 - Manuj: Dude same
02/06/2019, 17:56 - Tanveer: I'm worrieddddddd
02/06/2019, 17:57 - Sian: We all are tbh
02/06/2019, 17:58 - Tanveer: 😭
02/06/2019, 17:58 - Manuj: <Media omitted>
02/06/2019, 17:59 - Tanveer: Again I think you need to leave x² on its own
02/06/2019, 17:59 - Tabs: I usually go for a u sub bc it’s less prone to mistakes?
02/06/2019, 18:00 - Tanveer: Just let u = 2x in this case?
02/06/2019, 18:00 - Manuj: <Media omitted>
02/06/2019, 18:00 - Tanveer: *Y e s*
02/06/2019, 18:00 - Sian: No
02/06/2019, 18:00 - Manuj: Ohh
02/06/2019, 18:00 - Pablo Dent: Well you can use chain rule there
02/06/2019, 18:00 - Tanveer: Maybe
02/06/2019, 18:00 - Tabs: 2x^2 =sin^2u
02/06/2019, 18:00 - Manuj: Yh gotcha
02/06/2019, 18:01 - Sian: I did a question early where u had to complete the square so i had like an (x-1)^2 and it worked
02/06/2019, 18:01 - Tanveer: But then more sin stuff in the integral and it would fuck me uppp
02/06/2019, 18:01 - Tanveer: I hate substitutions
02/06/2019, 18:01 - Manuj: Okk and then it's the same as a u sub
02/06/2019, 18:02 - Manuj: <Media omitted>
02/06/2019, 18:02 - Tanveer: I'd do this
02/06/2019, 18:03 - Manuj: Wow there were so many ways of doing this right and I still managed to do it wrong
02/06/2019, 18:03 - Tanveer: me
02/06/2019, 18:03 - Tanveer: on so many levels
02/06/2019, 18:03 - Sian: Whats the actual answer?
02/06/2019, 18:03 - Manuj: π√2/4
02/06/2019, 18:03 - Sian: Ahh
02/06/2019, 18:03 - Tanveer: Show qu for this?
02/06/2019, 18:13 - Tanveer: Also is NR system / change of sign in core pure?
02/06/2019, 18:13 - Tanveer: etc?
02/06/2019, 18:13 - Haytham: No
02/06/2019, 18:13 - Tanveer: Where does it appear in
02/06/2019, 18:13 - Haytham: Numerical methods are in single maths
02/06/2019, 18:14 - Haytham: Change of sign can come up tho
02/06/2019, 18:14 - Tanveer: Thats pretty ez tho oke
02/06/2019, 18:14 - Tanveer: ty
02/06/2019, 18:15 - Sian: Especially when checking if ur integrating and the curve crosses
02/06/2019, 18:24 - Manuj: <Media omitted>
02/06/2019, 18:44 - Sian: I was guna make this so thank you

03/06/2019, 07:17 - Sian: Wear it anyway
03/06/2019, 07:17 - Tabs: Yeah I don’t think mine will fit over my cast so I’m wearing something else
03/06/2019, 07:18 - Eito Miyamura: I've basically failed core pure and physics 3
03/06/2019, 07:18 - Sian: We all have dw
03/06/2019, 07:18 - Eito Miyamura: I don't wanna come in soaked tbh
03/06/2019, 07:18 - Sian: Idek what physics paper 3 is like anymore
03/06/2019, 07:18 - Eito Miyamura: Oh shit big rip
03/06/2019, 07:21 - Pablo Dent: >says this
>gets triple A*

03/06/2019, 07:29 - Reemon Spector: Wash your own bloody clothes neek
03/06/2019, 07:31 - Eito Miyamura: Lmao funny joke after those physics papers
03/06/2019, 07:31 - Eito Miyamura: I washed my Russian fur coat at least xc
03/06/2019, 07:34 - Pablo Dent: ~russian~ coke addict
03/06/2019, 07:35 - Manuj: Literally same
03/06/2019, 07:43 - Eito Miyamura: I'm glad I'm not the only disappointment here
03/06/2019, 07:44 - Eito Miyamura: Also, what's the proper definition of a shear?
03/06/2019, 07:45 - Eito Miyamura: Ik one when I see one but it had some weird definitions with shear factors
03/06/2019, 07:45 - Daniel Batchford: <Media omitted>
03/06/2019, 07:46 - Tanveer: Shear. A transformation in which all points along a given line remain fixed while other points are shifted parallel to by a distance proportional to their perpendicular distance from . Shearing a plane figure does not change its area.
03/06/2019, 07:46 - Reemon Spector: Nais
03/06/2019, 07:49 - Pablo Dent: For a level we only need to know parallel to x or y axis
03/06/2019, 07:50 - Eito Miyamura: Sik ty
03/06/2019, 07:50 - Pablo Dent: 1 0        1 a
a 1   or  0 1
03/06/2019, 07:52 - Reemon Spector: Is a composition of shears still a shear
03/06/2019, 07:52 - Reemon Spector: Or just in certain special cases
03/06/2019, 08:03 - Eito Miyamura: If its in the same direction then surely it is
03/06/2019, 08:06 - Eito Miyamura: Also @447491084684 the best I got this half term with detective pikachu reynolds was to rank 2 on hearthstone
03/06/2019, 08:08 - Eito Miyamura: I'm sorry to dissapoint you
03/06/2019, 08:25 - Tanveer: What's disappointing is your spelling
03/06/2019, 08:32 - Eito Miyamura: I thought dissapointing was with double s single p
03/06/2019, 08:32 - Eito Miyamura: Nvm I'm disappointing

12/07/2019, 15:48 - Pablo Dent: On “SAD!” X laments about the struggle of letting go of a loved one and the feeling of depression that follows.
He details emotions of uncertainty surrounding a specific relationship. He is insecure and heartbroken due to the fact that his girlfriend had left him, bringing about a melancholy vibe.
He also brings up suicide, a subject often discussed throughout his discography. For example, in the song “Jocelyn Flores” from his 2017 album, 17, he raps about a friend who suffered from depression and eventually killed herself.
This song was frequently teased as an intro of X’s gaming videos on his YouTube channel prior to its release.

13/07/2019, 23:29 - Pablo Dent: Sie nimmt mein Geld, wenn ich in Not bin
Ja, sie ist in der Tat eine kleine Freundin
Oh, sie ist eine Goldgräberin
Weit über der Stadt liegt das an mir
Jetzt sage ich nicht, dass sie eine Goldgräberin ist
(Wenn ich in Not bin) Aber sie spielt nicht ohne Niggas
(Sie gibt mir Geld) Nun, ich sage nicht, dass sie eine Goldgräberin ist
(Wenn ich in Not bin) Aber sie spielt nicht ohne Niggas
(Ich muss gehen) Runter Mädchen, geh 'Kopf, runter
(Ich muss gehen) Runter Mädchen, geh 'Kopf, runter
(Ich muss gehen) Runter Mädchen, geh 'Kopf, runter
(Ich muss gehen) Runter Mädchen, geh 'Kopf
Cutie, die Bombe, traf sie in einem Schönheitssalon
Mit einem Baby Louis Vuitton unter den Achseln
Sie sagte: "Ich kann es dir sagen, Rock, ich kann es an deinem Charme erkennen
Was Mädchen betrifft, hast du eine Herde
Ich kann es an deinem Charme und deinem Arm erkennen. "
Aber ich suche die, hast du sie gesehen?
Meine Hellseherin hat mir gesagt, dass sie einen Arsch wie Serena haben wird
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, vier Kinder
Und ich muss alles, was schlecht ist, zu ShowBiz bringen?
Okay, hol deine Kinder, aber dann haben sie ihre Freunde
Ich bin im Benz angehalten, sie sind alle eingestiegen
Wir gingen alle essen und dann musste ich bezahlen
Wenn du mit diesem Mädchen fickst, solltest du besser bezahlt werden
Du weißt, warum? Es braucht zu viel, um sie zu berühren
Nach allem, was ich gehört habe, hat sie von Busta ein Baby bekommen
Meine beste Freundin sagte, sie habe mit Usher gefickt
Es ist mir egal, was keiner von euch sagt, ich liebe sie immer noch
Jetzt sage ich nicht, dass sie eine Goldgräberin ist
(Wenn ich in Not bin) Aber sie spielt nicht ohne Niggas
(Sie gibt mir Geld) Nun, ich sage nicht, dass sie eine Goldgräberin ist
(Wenn ich in Not bin) Aber sie spielt nicht ohne Niggas
(Ich muss gehen) Runter Mädchen, geh 'Kopf, runter
(Ich muss gehen) Runter Mädchen, geh 'Kopf, runter
(Ich muss gehen) Runter Mädchen, geh 'Kopf, runter
(Ich muss gehen) Runter Mädchen, geh 'Kopf
Achtzehn Jahre, achtzehn Jahre
Sie hat eins von Ihren Kindern, hat Sie für achtzehn Jahre
Ich kenne jemanden, der Kindergeld für eines seiner Kinder zahlt
Sein Baby Mama Auto und Kinderbett ist größer als sein
Sie werden ihn jeden Sonntag im Fernsehen sehen
Gewinne den Super Bowl und fahre mit einem Hyundai los
Sie sollte Ihren Shorty Tyco mit Ihrem Geld kaufen
Sie ist zum Arzt gegangen und hat Lipo mit deinem Geld bekommen
Sie läuft herum und sieht aus wie Michael mit deinem Geld
Hätte das versichern sollen, Geico für dein Geld
Wenn du kein Punk bist
Holla, "Wir wollen Prenup! Wir wollen Prenup!" (Ja!)
Es ist etwas, was du haben musst
Denn wenn sie deinen Arsch verlässt, wird sie mit der Hälfte gehen
Achtzehn Jahre, achtzehn Jahre
Und am 18. Geburtstag fand er heraus, dass es nicht sein war ?!
Jetzt sage ich nicht, dass sie eine Goldgräberin ist
(Wenn ich in Not bin) Aber sie spielt nicht ohne Niggas
(Sie gibt mir Geld) Nun, ich sage nicht, dass sie eine Goldgräberin ist
(Wenn ich in Not bin) Aber sie spielt nicht ohne Niggas
(Ich muss gehen) Runter Mädchen, geh 'Kopf, runter
(Ich muss gehen) Runter Mädchen, geh 'Kopf, runter
(Ich muss gehen) Runter Mädchen, geh 'Kopf, runter
(Ich muss gehen) Runter Mädchen, geh 'Kopf
Nun, ich sage dir nicht, dass du ein Goldgräber bist, du hast Bedürfnisse
Du willst nicht, dass ein Typ raucht, aber er kann kein Gras kaufen
Du gehst essen, er kann nicht bezahlen, du kannst nicht gehen
Hinten ist Geschirr, er muss die Ärmel hochkrempeln
Aber während ihr wascht, passt auf ihn auf
Er wird es aus diesem Datsun zu einem Benz schaffen
Er hat diesen Ehrgeiz, Baby, schau auf seine Augen
Diese Woche wischt er die Böden, nächste Woche sind es die Pommes
Also bleib an seiner Seite
Ich weiß, da sind Jungs, und ja, das ist schön
Und sie werden weiter anrufen und es versuchen, aber du bleibst richtig, Mädchen
Und wenn du einsteigst, wird er dir den Arsch für ein weißes Mädchen überlassen
Runter Mädchen, geh 'Kopf, runter
(Ich muss gehen) Runter Mädchen, geh 'Kopf, runter
(Ich muss gehen) Runter Mädchen, geh 'Kopf, runter
(Ich muss gehen) Runter Mädchen, geh 'Kopf
Lass mich das zurück hören

In a saucer flying.

18/07/2019, 16:23 - Sian: Maybe dont go to illegal poker clubs
18/07/2019, 16:24 - Sian: Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police! That's the sound of the beast!
Stand clear! Don man a-talk
You can't stand where I stand, you can't walk where I walk
Watch out! We run New York
Police man come, we bust him out the park
I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act
You claim I'm sellin' crack
But you be doin' that
I'd rather say "see ya"
Cause I would never be ya
Be a officer? You wicked overseer!
Ya hotshot, want to get props and be a savior
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?
Or when my car is hooked up, you know you want to follow me
Your laws are minimal
Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
This has got to cease
Cause we be getting hyped to the sound of da police!
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police! That's the sound of the beast!
Now here's a likkle truth
Open up your eye
While you're checking out the boom-bap, check the exercise
Take the word "overseer, " like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew for example
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Officer, Officer, Officer, Officer!
Yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity?
Check the similarity!
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off patrolling all the nation
The overseer could stop you what you're doing
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest!
(Woop!) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've got no choices!
The police them have a little gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police! That's the sound of the beast!
Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminals are the see-O-P
You check for undercover and the one PD
But just a mere Black man, them want check me
Them check out me car for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up til today
But the Black police officer nah see it that way
Him want a salary
Him want it
So he put on a badge and kill people for it
My grandfather had to deal with the cops
My great-grandfather dealt with the cops
My great grandfather had to deal with the cops
And then my great, great, great, great, when it's gonna stop?!
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police! That's the sound of the beast!

27/07/2019, 11:02 - Michael: Forreal tho it was non consensual
27/07/2019, 11:02 - Mark: Nah i swear it was
27/07/2019, 11:04 - Michael: U swear it was non consensual
27/07/2019, 11:04 - Tanveer: What is it
27/07/2019, 11:04 - Michael: Yea ur right
27/07/2019, 11:05 - Manuj: If liquid takes an hour to flow out of cylinder of height and diameter X then how long will it take to flow out of a hemisphere of radius X
27/07/2019, 11:05 - Manuj: I'm tryna figure out how long this saline is gonna take to empty
27/07/2019, 11:05 - Tanveer: Like is it flowing out from the bottom of the dome part or the circle face part
27/07/2019, 11:06 - Manuj: Bottom
27/07/2019, 11:06 - Tanveer: How big is the opening
27/07/2019, 11:06 - Manuj: It's flowing at a constant rate
27/07/2019, 11:06 - Tanveer: Ohh okk
27/07/2019, 11:06 - Tanveer: We don't need actual size
27/07/2019, 11:06 - Tanveer: Hmm
27/07/2019, 11:06 - Manuj: Ye
27/07/2019, 11:06 - Tanveer: Well that's a nice problem
27/07/2019, 11:07 - Manuj: I don't have paper and my right hand had needle in it or I would've worked it out myself
27/07/2019, 11:07 - Manuj: Has
27/07/2019, 11:07 - Tanveer: <Media omitted>
27/07/2019, 11:08 - Manuj: 😂😂
27/07/2019, 11:10 - Manuj: Is it 20 mins
27/07/2019, 11:11 - Michael: I think that would be for a cone of radius X
27/07/2019, 11:11 - Michael: And height X
27/07/2019, 11:12 - Tanveer: Cuz a cone is a 1/3
27/07/2019, 11:12 - Tanveer: But what about a hemisphere
27/07/2019, 11:12 - Michael: But idk if that’s how maths works
27/07/2019, 11:12 - Manuj: <Media omitted>
27/07/2019, 11:14 - Michael: Oh madd
27/07/2019, 11:14 - Michael: Yeah a cone would be 10 mins
27/07/2019, 11:14 - Mark: Jus do volume of hemisphere over volume of cylinder all the xs cancel
27/07/2019, 11:15 - Michael: Thats what he did in the audio
27/07/2019, 11:15 - Mark: Ah fairs
27/07/2019, 11:16 - Tanveer: Shit, height and *diameter* X
27/07/2019, 11:16 - Tanveer: Misread
27/07/2019, 11:16 - Tanveer: Good job hospital boi
27/07/2019, 11:16 - Catherine: Guys. One of my kids tried to get me to catch a case.
27/07/2019, 11:17 - Tanveer: Kids? Case?
27/07/2019, 11:18 - Catherine: She shipped me with one of the kids I was teaching.

27/07/2019, 11:24 - Catherine: And when I told her yes, she seemed really disappointed.
27/07/2019, 11:24 - Catherine: And when I asked her why.
27/07/2019, 11:25 - Catherine: She kept looking at me and him together.
27/07/2019, 11:25 - Catherine: And I was like.
27/07/2019, 11:25 - Catherine: _Nope._

27/07/2019, 11:27 - Tanveer: Well then
27/07/2019, 11:28 - Catherine: _I'm the one that's meant to make people catch cases, I'm not supposed to *catch* a case._
27/07/2019, 11:32 - Manuj: My bois

29/07/2019, 13:39 - Catherine: Nu.
29/07/2019, 13:39 - Haytham: :(
29/07/2019, 13:44 - Catherine: What maths is it anyway?
29/07/2019, 13:44 - Catherine: If it's 11+ or GCSE maths I'll help.
29/07/2019, 13:44 - Catherine: They're fun to do.
29/07/2019, 13:44 - Catherine: Or verbal and non-verbal tests.
29/07/2019, 13:44 - Haytham: <Media omitted>
29/07/2019, 13:45 - Catherine: No clue.
29/07/2019, 13:45 - Catherine: Someone good at maths go and help.
29/07/2019, 13:46 - Haytham: Oh yea and p is prime
29/07/2019, 13:46 - Haytham: And a and b are integers
29/07/2019, 13:47 - Mark: If you binomially expand it dont just all the other terms multiples of p
29/07/2019, 13:48 - Haytham: I think so but I’m trying to prove that
29/07/2019, 13:50 - Mark: Is this definitely true?
29/07/2019, 13:50 - Haytham: I checked up to p=13 and it looks true
29/07/2019, 13:51 - Mark: Wait
29/07/2019, 13:51 - Mark: P has to be prime right
29/07/2019, 13:51 - Haytham: Yes
29/07/2019, 13:51 - Mark: Otherwise it breaks at p=4 xd
29/07/2019, 13:52 - Mark: Its cos primes are coprime with all numbers lower than them
29/07/2019, 13:52 - Mark: So pCanything is always a multiple of p
29/07/2019, 13:53 - Mark: Cause the p! in the numerator doesnt get cancelled out by anything in the denominator cause all the factorial terms are lower and therefore coprime to p
29/07/2019, 13:57 - Mark: If that made any sense xd
29/07/2019, 13:57 - Haytham: The p doesn’t cancel but the other terms from the p! can
29/07/2019, 13:59 - Mark: Ye
29/07/2019, 14:01 - Haytham: <Media omitted>
29/07/2019, 14:37 - Mark: Ye thats the choose function
29/07/2019, 14:37 - Mark: Its always an integer cause it relates to real life
29/07/2019, 14:42 - Haytham: pCk is an integer yes but we need to show that pCk is p times an integer
29/07/2019, 14:42 - Haytham: Bruh I’m still stuck
29/07/2019, 15:12 - Tanveer: Anyone near Hyde Park?

29/07/2019, 19:18 - Manuj: The I'm glad you came parody
29/07/2019, 19:18 - Reemon Spector: pCk = p!/k!(p-k)! = p•(p-1)!/k!(p-k)!
Consider the brackets: (p-1)!/k!(p-k)! and let this be A. Now to prove A belongs to Z given that 0<k<p:
A•(p-k)!/(p-k-1)! = (p-1)Ck so A = ((p-k-1)!/(p-k!))•(p-1)Ck = (p-1)Ck/(p-k) is as far as I got but go ham from there?
29/07/2019, 19:18 - Reemon Spector: Soz I'm just a few hrs late 😂
29/07/2019, 19:18 - Reemon Spector: And kinda useless

11/08/2019, 12:16 - +44 7443 576939: It's about acceptable age gaps in relationships

11/08/2019, 12:18 - +44 7443 576939: He made a new theorem?
11/08/2019, 12:19 - +44 7443 576939: Maybe that was Haytham's theorem
11/08/2019, 12:19 - Pablo Dent: He has many
11/08/2019, 12:19 - +44 7412 888557: what was his age one?
11/08/2019, 12:20 - +44 7443 576939: I don't think you want to know tbh, but it's the usual Eito stuff
11/08/2019, 12:21 - Haytham: It was that one free period where eito tried to define a function which maps an age to a minimum socially acceptable age of a person you can date. I think it’s called Eito’s function
11/08/2019, 12:21 - +44 7443 576939: Ahhh yes, that was it

11/08/2019, 12:58 - Eito Miyamura: It had a very nice shape graph too
11/08/2019, 12:58 - Eito Miyamura: Mb it was called that
11/08/2019, 12:59 - Haytham: Mrs Carey?
11/08/2019, 13:12 - Eito Miyamura: It was called the Golden Theorem
11/08/2019, 13:30 - Haytham: What’s that one?

Thirty years later Sebastian told us: "I had to start my car like a computer. It's very complicated." And Nico Rosbeg said, err, he pressed during the race, I don't remember what race, the wrong button on the wheel. Question for you to both. Is formula 1 driving today too complicated with 20 and more buttons on the wheel, are you too much under effort, under pressure? What are your wishes for the future, concerning technical program, errrm, during the race? Less buttons, more? Or less and more comunication with your engineers.

25/08/2019, 00:35 - Pablo Dent: Everyone jokes about grilling, but they all forget about people like me. I have existed in a constant state of grilling since a BBQ in 1997. I have been attending this charcoal grill for twenty-two years. Do you genuinely think I can make time to argue about politics? Don't make me laugh. I have been flipping this exact burger for a third of my life. It's been decades why is it still raw. It's literally not cooking and I'm not allowed to leave. It's been over a fucking a flame for 22 years and it's still fucking frozen. What fucking vengeful god cursed me with this. help

25/08/2019, 01:24 - Tanveer: Gentlemen, a short view back to the past. Thirty years ago, Niki Lauda told us: "Take a trained monkey, place him into the cockpit and he is able to drive the car." Thirty years later Sebastian told us: "I had to start my car like a computer. It's very complicated." And Nico Rosbeg said, err, he pressed during the race, I don't remember what race, the wrong button on the wheel. Question for you to both. Is formula 1 driving today too complicated with 20 and more buttons on the wheel, are you too much under effort, under pressure? What are your wishes for the future, concerning technical program, errrm, during the race? Less buttons, more? Or less and more comunication with your engineers.

13/10/2019, 18:47 - Sian: I need to do mine
14/10/2019, 08:50 - Haytham: Manuj wants to know Eito’s theorem but he’s not old enough yet
14/10/2019, 08:54 - Eito Miyamura: You need a lot of age
14/10/2019, 09:38 - Manuj: I have like 19 years of age
14/10/2019, 09:38 - Haytham: Lmaooo why u so small then

14/10/2019, 11:52 - Haytham: Wow maybe now he’s d enough to learn about Eito’s theorem
14/10/2019, 12:00 - Sian: Yes
14/10/2019, 19:10 - Eito Miyamura: Greeks are great
14/10/2019, 19:10 - Eito Miyamura: They have a great sense of humour and is super chill
14/10/2019, 19:11 - Eito Miyamura: ~also takes care of me when I am drunk~
14/10/2019, 20:14 - Manuj: I'm not
14/10/2019, 20:14 - Manuj: That's why I said like 19
14/10/2019, 20:16 - Michael: Are you in Greece?
14/10/2019, 20:29 - Eito Miyamura: I was going to say
14/10/2019, 20:29 - Eito Miyamura: Nah there's just a lot of Greeks around me xd
14/10/2019, 20:46 - Haytham: Have you applied Eito’s theorem yet?
14/10/2019, 20:47 - Manuj: I
14/10/2019, 20:47 - Manuj: Dont
14/10/2019, 20:47 - Manuj: Jnow
14/10/2019, 20:47 - Manuj: Know
14/10/2019, 20:47 - Manuj: What
14/10/2019, 20:47 - Manuj: It is
14/10/2019, 20:47 - Haytham: @447463867907 maybe we should tell him
14/10/2019, 21:00 - Bence: He's too young
14/10/2019, 21:12 - Tanveer: <Media omitted>
14/10/2019, 21:13 - Michael: Tragic times
14/10/2019, 21:13 - Michael: Their fans are hella racist tho
14/10/2019, 21:13 - Michael: They were gonna cancel the game because of it
14/10/2019, 21:13 - Tanveer: Rly? Jeez
14/10/2019, 21:16 - Tanveer: It's 5-0 now
14/10/2019, 21:22 - Michael: Bruh
14/10/2019, 21:22 - Michael: How many mins left
14/10/2019, 21:22 - Tanveer: 15
14/10/2019, 21:23 - Michael: 1 goal every 3 mins let’s go 😎😎
14/10/2019, 21:27 - Tanveer: Let's gooo
14/10/2019, 21:31 - Tanveer: Fuck 6-0
14/10/2019, 21:31 - Tanveer: 6 mins
14/10/2019, 21:32 - Michael: Now that is an epic gamer moment
14/10/2019, 21:52 - Eito Miyamura: If college marriage counts
14/10/2019, 21:52 - Eito Miyamura: You've already posted before
14/10/2019, 21:52 - Eito Miyamura: Let H,A,Ag,Og be a set 
|H|= 7.53*10^9
A⊂H
Ag⊂A
Og⊂Ag

a∈Og => h🖤a
where h∈H

example: 
Ak ∈ Og
=> h🖤Ak
14/10/2019, 21:59 - Manuj: What does that mean tho
14/10/2019, 22:00 - Haytham: That’s an exercise
14/10/2019, 22:00 - Eito Miyamura: For the reader
14/10/2019, 22:00 - Manuj: Can you at least tell me if I'm right
14/10/2019, 22:00 - Eito Miyamura: Ye
14/10/2019, 22:00 - Manuj: H is the set of all ppl
14/10/2019, 22:01 - Manuj: On earth
14/10/2019, 22:01 - Eito Miyamura: Ye
14/10/2019, 22:02 - Manuj: Why did you choose the letter H to represent that
14/10/2019, 22:02 - Manuj: Anyway
14/10/2019, 22:03 - Manuj: Does Ag stand for All girls and Og stand for Old girls
14/10/2019, 22:03 - Pablo Dent: Humanity
14/10/2019, 22:03 - Manuj: And h is haytham
14/10/2019, 22:03 - Manuj: Haytham loves old girls
14/10/2019, 22:03 - Michael: Ahhh a is asuka
14/10/2019, 22:03 - Michael: Ag is asian girls?
14/10/2019, 22:03 - Manuj: I think that's Ak
14/10/2019, 22:03 - Pablo Dent: It should absolutely be G_a and G_o
14/10/2019, 22:03 - Eito Miyamura: Wait lemme correct one thing about the theorem:

Let H,A,Ag,Og be a set 
|H|= 7.53*10^9
A⊂H
Ag⊂A
Og⊂Ag

∀a∈Og => h🖤a
where h∈H

example: 
Ak ∈ Og
=> h🖤Ak
14/10/2019, 22:04 - Haytham: A mistake 😳
14/10/2019, 22:04 - Manuj: Ak is definitely Asuka
14/10/2019, 22:04 - Reemon Spector: ~Theorem~ 👉 _Conjecture_
14/10/2019, 22:04 - Manuj: Yea maybe
14/10/2019, 22:04 - Michael: Oh yea shit
14/10/2019, 22:04 - Manuj: Og is Oriental girls!
14/10/2019, 22:04 - Eito Miyamura: @447491084684 please correct it into a theorem
14/10/2019, 22:04 - Manuj: *?
14/10/2019, 22:05 - Pablo Dent: Yah
14/10/2019, 22:05 - Michael: Oriental is a subset of asian
14/10/2019, 22:05 - Manuj: Because then oriental girls is a subset of Asian girls
14/10/2019, 22:05 - Michael: Ofc ofc
14/10/2019, 22:05 - Manuj: Yeahh
14/10/2019, 22:05 - Reemon Spector: Proof by example?
14/10/2019, 22:05 - Manuj: And A might just be Asians
14/10/2019, 22:05 - Eito Miyamura: Already has examples in the proof
14/10/2019, 22:05 - Manuj: Are we correct?
14/10/2019, 22:05 - Michael: What’s a and Ak then
14/10/2019, 22:05 - Eito Miyamura: Ye you got it 100% xd
14/10/2019, 22:05 - Manuj: Ayyyy
14/10/2019, 22:05 - Eito Miyamura: Big brain
14/10/2019, 22:06 - Manuj: a is a random oriental girl
14/10/2019, 22:06 - Manuj: And Ak is Asuka
14/10/2019, 22:06 - Eito Miyamura: Rip now the mystery is gone
14/10/2019, 22:06 - Eito Miyamura: Yeah hence the for all
14/10/2019, 22:06 - Michael: Ah cuz Ak is an example of a
14/10/2019, 22:06 - Manuj: Yeee
14/10/2019, 22:06 - Eito Miyamura: ~although Haytham supposedly disagrees~
14/10/2019, 22:06 - Reemon Spector: Ofc this is what a compsci student would consider a proof
14/10/2019, 22:06 - Manuj: Wow I feel weirdly fulfilled
14/10/2019, 22:06 - Reemon Spector: 😂
14/10/2019, 22:06 - Eito Miyamura: You were the one who said this
14/10/2019, 22:07 - Haytham: It’s not even a true theorem I just like the way it’s written
14/10/2019, 22:07 - Eito Miyamura: You now know what me Haytham and Andres spent like a whole double free doing
14/10/2019, 22:07 - Reemon Spector: I think Eito's Theorem is a good name for the Miyamura Conjecture but that's about where I draw the line
14/10/2019, 22:08 - Michael: Do a similar thing for haytham and ms reid
14/10/2019, 22:08 - Haytham: Yea idek what a girl is
14/10/2019, 22:08 - Michael: But with 🙏🏻 instead of 🖤
14/10/2019, 22:08 - Eito Miyamura: It's a suitable substitution
14/10/2019, 22:08 - Eito Miyamura: 😂😂😂
14/10/2019, 22:08 - Haytham: 🤝
14/10/2019, 22:08 - Michael: Somewhere between 🙏🏻and🤝
14/10/2019, 22:08 - Eito Miyamura: It was not this civilized
14/10/2019, 22:09 - Reemon Spector: Also I think you made me check it so I guessed it's peer-reviewed
14/10/2019, 22:09 - Michael: Lool
14/10/2019, 22:09 - Reemon Spector: You can basically publish it now
14/10/2019, 22:09 - Reemon Spector: <Media omitted>
14/10/2019, 22:09 - Eito Miyamura: Yeah imagine a Spector approved theorem
14/10/2019, 22:13 - Michael: Wait shouldn’t it be there exists instead of for all
14/10/2019, 22:14 - Michael: Nvm

15/10/2019, 22:51 - Eito Miyamura: Fkin insanity
15/10/2019, 22:52 - Eito Miyamura: He pees in his sink but he's still a great human being like Jed too
15/10/2019, 22:52 - Haytham: Who doesn’t pee in the sink
15/10/2019, 22:52 - Haytham: It all goes in the same drain anyway

15/10/2019, 22:57 - Haytham: Yea it is that’s why I use the toilet 👍🏾
15/10/2019, 22:59 - Eito Miyamura: You're corrupting your sink with piss where you also brush your teeth
15/10/2019, 22:59 - Eito Miyamura: Imagine getting piss in your tooth
15/10/2019, 23:00 - Haytham: Unless you can aim correctly and get it straight down the plug hole
15/10/2019, 23:01 - Eito Miyamura: I've never seen someone that advanced
15/10/2019, 23:01 - Eito Miyamura: It's actually kinda disgusting actually a second year just randomly told me he came into my sink
15/10/2019, 23:02 - Haytham: Ok that’s very strange
15/10/2019, 23:02 - Haytham: Only eito would do something that strange
15/10/2019, 23:03 - Eito Miyamura: No so
15/10/2019, 23:03 - Eito Miyamura: This guy who's in second year who used to use my room

15/10/2019, 23:04 - Haytham: Glad you’ve found a big brother figure
15/10/2019, 23:04 - Eito Miyamura: He's basically more of my dad
15/10/2019, 23:05 - Haytham: Apply Eito’s theorem to him
15/10/2019, 23:18 - Eito Miyamura: No thanks
16/10/2019, 00:13 - Mark: So you cum in your sink too?

22/10/2019, 13:00 - Nick: I think half this chat would die if they did keto
22/10/2019, 13:00 - Catherine: You just shove to handfuls into a pot and boil it.

22/10/2019, 13:02 - Sian: I share a kettle
22/10/2019, 13:02 - Catherine: Don't think any of us would survive the keto diet in a day.
22/10/2019, 13:02 - Catherine: We would accidentally eat like two portions of carbs.
22/10/2019, 13:02 - Sian: I lowkey wana try it
22/10/2019, 13:02 - Pablo Dent: keto doesnt kick in for like a few days
22/10/2019, 13:02 - Catherine: Like mash and potatoes in a dish.

22/10/2019, 13:02 - Sian: Does fat steak count?
22/10/2019, 13:02 - Catherine: I agree.
22/10/2019, 13:02 - Nick: just have a burger but instead of bread salad
22/10/2019, 13:02 - Pablo Dent: _mash and potatoes_
22/10/2019, 13:03 - Sian: Can i just eat steak and nothing else for a week?

22/10/2019, 13:03 - Catherine: I like my burger patties in toast ngl.
22/10/2019, 13:03 - Sian: But it would be worth it
22/10/2019, 13:03 - Pablo Dent: thats called the baller diet
22/10/2019, 13:03 - Catherine: How do you survive?

22/10/2019, 13:04 - Pablo Dent: in what way
22/10/2019, 13:04 - Pablo Dent: there is no benefit to eating only steak for a week
22/10/2019, 13:04 - Catherine: I wish.
22/10/2019, 13:04 - Sian: Chips have to be so thin they basically have no potato
22/10/2019, 13:04 - Sian: And crisps are ok but i rarely eat them but even so i prefer corn chips like doritos
22/10/2019, 13:04 - Catherine: But the amount of chips you eat is basically at least one jacket potato.
22/10/2019, 13:04 - Sian: Taste
22/10/2019, 13:04 - Catherine: You would get bored of it.
22/10/2019, 13:04 - Catherine: Which is difficult.
22/10/2019, 13:04 - Sian: Even at home id have chips like twice a month
22/10/2019, 13:04 - Catherine: But possibly I guess.
22/10/2019, 13:05 - Catherine: I want steak now.
22/10/2019, 13:05 - Pablo Dent: you would absolutely get b ored
22/10/2019, 13:05 - Sian: Here i made them once but i got shit oven ones burnt myself making them and they tasted like chemicals so i didnt even eat them

26/10/2019, 04:46 - Sian: Ejaculate in the kettle before they do to assert ur dominance

26/10/2019, 11:12 - Eito Miyamura: I think they would maybe not mind drinking their own semen in tea
26/10/2019, 11:12 - Eito Miyamura: After all some people drink their own semen
26/10/2019, 11:13 - +44 7412 888557: Oke then you do it first to make them tea
26/10/2019, 11:15 - Eito Miyamura: I don't want semen in my kettle to begin with '(
26/10/2019, 11:23 - +44 7412 888557: Well sometimes you gotta make sacrifices
26/10/2019, 15:13 - Eito Miyamura: Holy shit
26/10/2019, 15:13 - Pablo Dent: What have you done now
26/10/2019, 15:13 - Eito Miyamura: I found out today that my next door neighbour actually proved a theorem
26/10/2019, 15:14 - Eito Miyamura: And tattooed it onto his arm
26/10/2019, 15:14 - Eito Miyamura: He's also the same person trying to ejaculate into my kettle
26/10/2019, 15:14 - Eito Miyamura: He's fully published a paper too with proofs and colloaries
26/10/2019, 15:14 - Bence: Eito, are you developing Alzheimers?

26/10/2019, 15:15 - Bence: He's definitely said that yesterday, and I think he's even mentioned it before
26/10/2019, 15:33 - Eito Miyamura: Oh maybe I just forgot cuz alcohol
26/10/2019, 15:34 - Eito Miyamura: <Media omitted>

26/10/2019, 15:36 - Eito Miyamura: Yeah but Mr ejacintokettleman actually proved it and published it
26/10/2019, 15:37 - Nick: god damn
26/10/2019, 15:37 - Eito Miyamura: Which is like 8 tiers above just tattooing it
26/10/2019, 15:37 - Pablo Dent: Like that means a little more to them
26/10/2019, 15:37 - Eito Miyamura: He's a fkin legend but also possibly more retarded than me
26/10/2019, 15:38 - Eito Miyamura: ?
26/10/2019, 15:38 - Bence: I told him that tattoo is stupid, and he said that he respects me for saying that
26/10/2019, 15:39 - Eito Miyamura: It's still smth to be proud about by engraining it to your body
26/10/2019, 15:40 - Bence: Oh, right, the reason you don't remember this exchange is because you were out of the room. He said this as he was cumming into your Kings mug
26/10/2019, 15:40 - Eito Miyamura: He's literally writing another proof for some other problem Rn too + his proof got sourced in other proofs
26/10/2019, 15:40 - Eito Miyamura: Wtf
26/10/2019, 15:41 - Pablo Dent: Oxford is a next level of retarded
26/10/2019, 15:42 - Bence: It brings me great joy that I just know Eito is currently washing his Kings mug because of what I said
26/10/2019, 15:43 - Eito Miyamura: The fun thing is that Ioannis used the cup yesterday to drink the Malibu and milk so he probably couldn't distinguish between milk and semen
26/10/2019, 16:05 - Pablo Dent: I never want to read a message from you again about semen
26/10/2019, 16:05 - Pablo Dent: Please
26/10/2019, 16:08 - Eito Miyamura: Unfortunately my room is somehow prone to everything that related
26/10/2019, 16:18 - Pablo Dent: Stop

27/10/2019, 23:37 - Eito Miyamura: Yes
27/10/2019, 23:37 - Eito Miyamura: It's the best way to go
28/10/2019, 00:29 - Pablo Dent: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDCcuCHOIyY this is actually crazy
28/10/2019, 00:30 - Pablo Dent: mind field is now out for free on youtube and this episode is genuinely mind blowing
28/10/2019, 00:30 - Sian: Stop distracting me i wana watch it now but i got 3 sheets to finish
28/10/2019, 00:32 - Tanveer: Finish it
28/10/2019, 00:37 - Pablo Dent: Oke its not that interesting
28/10/2019, 00:37 - Pablo Dent: Not interesting at all
28/10/2019, 00:38 - Pablo Dent: No reason to watch actually
28/10/2019, 00:42 - Mark: Did it get bad later on or something im confused
28/10/2019, 00:42 - Sian: Have u guys done the analysis sheet?
28/10/2019, 00:42 - Tanveer: 🤦🏽‍♂
28/10/2019, 00:42 - Haytham: Yes
28/10/2019, 00:43 - Pablo Dent: (I'm trying to convince sian to do the work you retard)
28/10/2019, 00:43 - Tanveer: Anal 1 or anal 2?
28/10/2019, 00:43 - Pablo Dent: Its like 10mins
28/10/2019, 00:43 - Pablo Dent: Super easy
28/10/2019, 00:43 - Sian: How do i do the proof besides that i can do it
28/10/2019, 00:43 - Pablo Dent: Which questions
28/10/2019, 00:44 - Haytham: Anal n as n tends to infinity
28/10/2019, 00:44 - Sian: 2 and well 3 and uhhh 4
28/10/2019, 00:44 - Pablo Dent: <Media omitted>
28/10/2019, 00:44 - Pablo Dent: 3 is easy
28/10/2019, 00:44 - Mark: Oh fine
28/10/2019, 00:45 - Pablo Dent: 4 just think about what an injection is
28/10/2019, 00:45 - Pablo Dent: it is a really great episode
28/10/2019, 00:45 - Sian: Isnt 3 just like oh if u choose epsilon < 1 as its just small and above 0 then ya fucked
28/10/2019, 00:47 - Pablo Dent: yeah
28/10/2019, 00:48 - Pablo Dent: yeah i just used 1/2
28/10/2019, 00:48 - Sian: Okiu
28/10/2019, 02:14 - Sian: Fml i still have like 4 questions to do across my worksheets
28/10/2019, 02:15 - Eito Miyamura: Relatable
28/10/2019, 02:16 - Sian: I dont know how to justify 1/n as being a null sequence
28/10/2019, 02:16 - Eito Miyamura: I have 2 left of linear Algebra :(
28/10/2019, 02:16 - Sian: I got 2 for analysis and 2 for physics
28/10/2019, 02:17 - Pablo Dent: You can just say this
28/10/2019, 02:17 - Sian: Can i actually
28/10/2019, 02:17 - Pablo Dent: Or if you wanna be extra you can literally just copy the definition but with numbers
28/10/2019, 02:17 - Sian: Also i cant do 4
28/10/2019, 02:18 - Pablo Dent: But most people on the discord seemed to agree it was fine
28/10/2019, 02:18 - Sian: Fairs
28/10/2019, 02:18 - Pablo Dent: If the function is strictly increasing then no two terms are the same
28/10/2019, 02:19 - Sian: Ik that like ik why its true im just shit at proofs
28/10/2019, 02:19 - Pablo Dent: Okay so you have a_n+1 > a_n
28/10/2019, 02:20 - Pablo Dent: So a_n ≠ a_n+1 ≠ a_n+2 etc
28/10/2019, 02:20 - Sian: Yh
28/10/2019, 02:20 - Pablo Dent: And since each one is greater than the last none are the same
28/10/2019, 02:21 - Pablo Dent: So its an injection
28/10/2019, 02:21 - Pablo Dent: I.e. a doesnt map any two inputs to the same value
28/10/2019, 02:22 - Pablo Dent: Or n≠m => an≠am
28/10/2019, 02:23 - Sian: Ah
28/10/2019, 02:23 - Sian: Tysm
28/10/2019, 02:23 - Pablo Dent: Nw nw

28/10/2019, 09:32 - Reemon Spector: Nais
28/10/2019, 09:33 - Pablo Dent: 'you can also describe complex numbers with absolute value and something called the _argument_ '
28/10/2019, 09:33 - Pablo Dent: Some real groundbreaking stuff
28/10/2019, 09:34 - Sian: ‘I knew what the answer was because ive seen complex conjugates before 😎’
28/10/2019, 09:34 - Reemon Spector: *makes FM a requirement to get an offer* 👉 *teaches FM from scratch*
28/10/2019, 09:34 - Haytham: Wow an argument thats what my parents have hahahhah
28/10/2019, 09:34 - Sian: ‘You can talk about how big it is’

28/10/2019, 09:35 - Sian: ‘We’ve all done pythagoras’ theorem’
28/10/2019, 09:38 - Sian: ‘I like this formula because it doesnt have any x or ys’
28/10/2019, 09:39 - Sian: ‘The square root of 1 is just 1’
28/10/2019, 09:44 - Sian: ‘It behaves well’
28/10/2019, 09:48 - Sian: ‘I wana give you a slight hint on how u get 5 from 4’
28/10/2019, 09:49 - Sian: ‘Then swap roles’
28/10/2019, 09:49 - Sian: ‘Convince yourself we are not doing anything stupid here’
28/10/2019, 10:07 - Sian: ‘We are grownup mathematicians not kids anymore’
28/10/2019, 10:08 - Sian: ‘This doesnt make any sense’
28/10/2019, 10:21 - Sian: ‘Its guna live up here’
28/10/2019, 10:24 - Sian: ‘Why have i bothered doing any of this’
28/10/2019, 10:30 - Eito Miyamura: Mood
28/10/2019, 10:33 - Sian: Same
28/10/2019, 10:43 - Eito Miyamura: You know a lecturer is great when they prove a result and then precedes to do it in a specific case
28/10/2019, 10:43 - Eito Miyamura: Like why
28/10/2019, 10:45 - Tanveer: Don't u have maths chat
28/10/2019, 10:45 - Reemon Spector: Coz you almost never use the thm in its general case?
28/10/2019, 10:45 - Reemon Spector: Don't u have engineers chat 😎

28/10/2019, 21:14 - Eito Miyamura: You'll have to buy it from all the tesco and 2x sainsburys
28/10/2019, 21:15 - Eito Miyamura: But no way of chopping it cuz no kitchen
28/10/2019, 21:15 - Eito Miyamura: I don't think you can do strew with kettle
28/10/2019, 21:15 - Sian: Thats fine
28/10/2019, 21:16 - Sian: I got the money
28/10/2019, 21:16 - Reemon Spector: you _must_ have some kind of basic kitchen facilities
28/10/2019, 21:17 - Reemon Spector: even if you don't, you have a desk in your room, it's kinda ghetto but like buy a chopping board and a knife
28/10/2019, 21:19 - Pablo Dent: Or
28/10/2019, 21:19 - Pablo Dent: Make less retarded wraps
28/10/2019, 21:19 - Pablo Dent: I had wraps today
28/10/2019, 21:19 - Pablo Dent: They were nice
28/10/2019, 21:20 - Pablo Dent: And consisted of a decent portion of carb, protein and most importantly flavour

28/10/2019, 21:30 - Pablo Dent: > Every time you send a photo of your food
28/10/2019, 21:31 - Eito Miyamura: eating shit food /= flex
28/10/2019, 21:32 - Pablo Dent: Ye but you're like 'oh this one is actually good'
28/10/2019, 21:32 - Haytham: Eito you should pick some grass from the college grounds and put it in a wrap
28/10/2019, 21:33 - Eito Miyamura: The only good ones have been scotch egg in a wrap
28/10/2019, 21:34 - Eito Miyamura: And chips ofc
28/10/2019, 21:34 - Reemon Spector: <Media omitted>

28/10/2019, 21:34 - Eito Miyamura: They have cameras is the thing
28/10/2019, 21:35 - Haytham: Catch a squirrel or something then we need more interesting wraps
28/10/2019, 21:35 - Eito Miyamura: Yeah but no way to cook the things I cut
28/10/2019, 21:36 - Eito Miyamura: Wtf 😂😅
28/10/2019, 21:36 - Reemon Spector: wait you have a kettle
28/10/2019, 21:36 - Reemon Spector: that means you have a plug socket
28/10/2019, 21:36 - Reemon Spector: just get a plate
28/10/2019, 21:36 - Eito Miyamura: No we can't
28/10/2019, 21:36 - Reemon Spector: I swear someone already said this
28/10/2019, 21:37 - Eito Miyamura: Cuz we're not allowed any cooking equipment other than kettles
28/10/2019, 21:37 - Reemon Spector: ...
28/10/2019, 21:37 - Eito Miyamura: Like we need to register all our electronics before we can use them and they reject toastie makers, microwaves etc
28/10/2019, 21:37 - Tanveer: <Media omitted>
28/10/2019, 21:37 - Eito Miyamura: I used to cook soba noodles but now I ran out

28/10/2019, 21:41 - Tanveer: spicy sauce in a wrap
28/10/2019, 21:41 - Eito Miyamura: As long as its edible
28/10/2019, 21:42 - Eito Miyamura: Which this isn't
28/10/2019, 21:42 - Sian: Nothing uve put in a wrap so far is really that edible
28/10/2019, 21:42 - Pablo Dent: Haha put a wrap in a wrap haha
28/10/2019, 21:42 - Eito Miyamura: You just say that cuz I put lettuce in a lot of my wraps 😤
28/10/2019, 21:43 - Eito Miyamura: Appreciate the breakfast ides
28/10/2019, 21:43 - Sian: Umm cereal and a cookie
28/10/2019, 21:44 - Eito Miyamura: But you would eat cereal and cookie
28/10/2019, 21:44 - Sian: Not in a wrap also that must of been hella dry
28/10/2019, 21:45 - Eito Miyamura: Wrap tastes neutral so it's fine
28/10/2019, 21:46 - Sian: Doesnt make it acceptable
28/10/2019, 21:47 - Tanveer: LOWW TIER FOOD
28/10/2019, 21:47 - Tanveer: MIXING WITH HIGH TIER FOOD
28/10/2019, 21:47 - Tanveer: 😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤
28/10/2019, 21:47 - Eito Miyamura: Anything is justifiable as long as you think hard enough
28/10/2019, 21:47 - Sian: Eito
28/10/2019, 21:47 - Eito Miyamura: I'm only mixing low tier foods together
28/10/2019, 21:47 - Eito Miyamura: Sian
28/10/2019, 21:47 - Tanveer: REEEEEEEEE
28/10/2019, 21:48 - Tanveer: DON'T TOUCH MY FOOD
28/10/2019, 21:48 - Tanveer: WITH OTHER FOODS
28/10/2019, 21:48 - Eito Miyamura: Since essentially I'm just making shitty wraps because hall is expensive
28/10/2019, 21:48 - Sian: Weve went through this discussion before
28/10/2019, 21:48 - Sian: Eito just let someone in another hall cook for u
28/10/2019, 21:49 - Eito Miyamura: I only want to preserve the quality of higher tier foods I can mix low tier foods
28/10/2019, 21:50 - Eito Miyamura: I'm actually planning to this week so ye nw
28/10/2019, 21:50 - Eito Miyamura: That reminds me Miles's college wife literally cooks and cleans for him it's quite funny
28/10/2019, 21:51 - Reemon Spector: Eito think about it this way
28/10/2019, 21:51 - Reemon Spector: you might be saving money on halls food
28/10/2019, 21:51 - Haytham: College wife????
28/10/2019, 21:51 - Reemon Spector: but you're also decreasing your life expectancy
28/10/2019, 21:51 - Reemon Spector: and if you live long enough, you'll make that money back ez, so...
28/10/2019, 21:51 - Reemon Spector: buying the hall food is actually cheaper in the long run
28/10/2019, 21:51 - Eito Miyamura: It's only a tiny bit tbh since it's like £4.41 vs £3.00
28/10/2019, 21:52 - Eito Miyamura: How tho
28/10/2019, 21:52 - Eito Miyamura: Yeah he got college married
28/10/2019, 21:52 - Reemon Spector: how many adults do you know of that eat wrap in a wrap every day?
28/10/2019, 21:52 - Reemon Spector: literally 0

02/11/2019, 11:04 - Nick: like if you don't get enough credits you fail
02/11/2019, 11:04 - Nick: no mainly from China and USA for master because it's taught in english
02/11/2019, 11:04 - Nick: whereas bachelor is taught in german
02/11/2019, 11:06 - Eito Miyamura: Ohhh I see

06/11/2019, 10:34 - Bence: Mama
06/11/2019, 10:42 - Bence: Joemama is Joe Swanson's African ancestor, who appeared in "Untitled Griffin Family History". He, like his descendant, is paraplegic, paralyzed from the waist down. In lieu of a wheelchair, he used a wild boar as his method of mobility. His best friends were Nate Griffin and Quagdingo. The three were captured by Cleveland from South Carolina, and brought to the American British colonies, along with Tobi, Ali Williams, and the African ancestors of Tom Tucker and Diane Simmons. It is unknown what became of Joemama following the arrival in the new world. The status of the wild boar is unknown as well.

06/11/2019, 20:21 - Eito Miyamura: how do you deal with a man sexually attracted to number 3 constantly dancing in your room
06/11/2019, 20:21 - Eito Miyamura: asking for a friend
06/11/2019, 21:14 - Mark: Number 3?
06/11/2019, 22:54 - Eito Miyamura: Yeah
06/11/2019, 22:54 - Eito Miyamura: He's sexually aroused by number 3
06/11/2019, 22:59 - Michael: Invite a couple into their room
06/11/2019, 22:59 - Michael: He’ll be so turned on by the fact that he’s a 3rd wheel that he’ll forget about dancing
06/11/2019, 23:00 - Eito Miyamura: No but like he's actually turned on by the shape of 3
06/11/2019, 23:00 - Eito Miyamura: Not the concept of 3
06/11/2019, 23:00 - Eito Miyamura: "3 is kinda curvy and I like it"
06/11/2019, 23:00 - Michael: Ah
06/11/2019, 23:00 - Michael: What’s wrong with 8
06/11/2019, 23:01 - Mark: 8 is kinda gay
06/11/2019, 23:01 - Eito Miyamura: I think the issue being that 8 is symmetrical
06/11/2019, 23:01 - Eito Miyamura: You're kinda gay
06/11/2019, 23:01 - Mark: False
06/11/2019, 23:10 - Pablo Dent: So is 3?
06/11/2019, 23:11 - Michael: Ah hence the “kinda”
06/11/2019, 23:11 - Eito Miyamura: 2 lines of symmetry vs 1
06/11/2019, 23:13 - Manuj: That weirdly makes sense
06/11/2019, 23:13 - Eito Miyamura: Also, a 3 is homeomorphic to a sphere whereas 8 is homeomorphic to a double torus
06/11/2019, 23:13 - Manuj: Cos humans have one line of symmetry
06/11/2019, 23:14 - Manuj: If they had 2 that would be weird
06/11/2019, 23:14 - Eito Miyamura: Manuj I miss your absurd logic
06/11/2019, 23:14 - Eito Miyamura: It's so bizzare
06/11/2019, 23:14 - Manuj: Thanks man

25/01/2020, 20:37 - Pablo Dent: but horribly failing
25/01/2020, 20:38 - Michael: ^
25/01/2020, 20:38 - Reemon Spector: X Y are iidrvs with X ~ U(0,1) same with Y
Is E(sqrt(X^2 + Y^2)) = sqrt(E(X^2 + Y^2))?
25/01/2020, 20:39 - Michael: Is that a u-quadratic distribution?
25/01/2020, 20:39 - Michael: Idk anything about those we haven’t covered that
25/01/2020, 20:39 - Pablo Dent: uniform no?
25/01/2020, 20:39 - Pablo Dent: if its u quadratic i cannot help
25/01/2020, 20:40 - Reemon Spector: Uniform
25/01/2020, 20:40 - Pablo Dent: ok ok good
25/01/2020, 20:40 - Michael: Oh yeah lol
25/01/2020, 20:40 - Reemon Spector: Lol
25/01/2020, 20:40 - Pablo Dent: also when i say stats module im doing like probability and counting
25/01/2020, 20:40 - Mark: The hell is u quadratic
25/01/2020, 20:40 - Mark: Sounds like a troll
25/01/2020, 20:41 - Pablo Dent: also i think no
25/01/2020, 20:41 - Reemon Spector: I thought so
25/01/2020, 20:41 - Reemon Spector: But hoped I would be wrong 😂
25/01/2020, 20:42 - Pablo Dent: since E(x^n) != E(x)^n so i assume that holds for non integer powers
25/01/2020, 20:42 - Michael: Je suis agree
25/01/2020, 20:42 - Michael: Also jensen’s inequality i think
25/01/2020, 20:43 - Pablo Dent: uh yeah that
25/01/2020, 20:43 - Pablo Dent: i totally know what that is
25/01/2020, 20:43 - Michael: Cuz e(sqrt) could be greater than/less than sqrt e (can’t remember which one)
25/01/2020, 20:44 - Reemon Spector: <Media omitted>
25/01/2020, 20:45 - Reemon Spector: Ok is this true

25/01/2020, 20:46 - Pablo Dent: sorry mate that looks a bit too continuous for me
25/01/2020, 20:46 - Reemon Spector: Inf

25/01/2020, 21:51 - Reemon Spector: I'd rather spend carefully all week and live in student debt for a few yrs than work 2 jobs a consistent 50+ hrs every week :/
25/01/2020, 21:52 - Pablo Dent: well ye true
25/01/2020, 21:53 - Pablo Dent: i couldnt do that lol

13/02/2020, 10:13 - Reemon Spector: I keep losing games idk why
13/02/2020, 10:14 - Eito Miyamura: Sub9 is too slow in this aggro meta
13/02/2020, 10:14 - Eito Miyamura: You usually never have enough time to play it
13/02/2020, 10:15 - Eito Miyamura: Also why double rat?
13/02/2020, 10:17 - Eito Miyamura: Similarly with dire frenzy so maybe replace those with like deadly shot or  albatross? Or extra secretkeepee
13/02/2020, 10:20 - Reemon Spector: I struggle against decks with lots of smol things, and I lack boardclear so I went for double rat to punish smol bois?
13/02/2020, 10:20 - Eito Miyamura: Oh
13/02/2020, 10:20 - Eito Miyamura: In that case put in like 2 copies of desert spear
13/02/2020, 10:20 - Reemon Spector: but Dire Frenzy is for the big hyena alphas
13/02/2020, 10:21 - Reemon Spector: I'll defo get rid of sub9 tho
13/02/2020, 10:21 - Eito Miyamura: That's like the best anti small boi weapon
13/02/2020, 10:21 - Eito Miyamura: Ye desert spear is best
13/02/2020, 10:21 - Eito Miyamura: If you have space albatross is really good btw
13/02/2020, 10:22 - Eito Miyamura: Solid 3 drop + ruins a lot of decks
13/02/2020, 10:22 - Reemon Spector: so get rid of sub9 for spear
13/02/2020, 10:22 - Reemon Spector: what's albatross?
13/02/2020, 10:22 - Eito Miyamura: Bad luck albatross
13/02/2020, 10:23 - Eito Miyamura: 3 mana 4/3 deathrattle shuffle 2 useless albatross into your opponents deck
13/02/2020, 10:23 - Eito Miyamura: It fucks with highlander decks well + druids
13/02/2020, 10:23 - Reemon Spector: huh

21/02/2020, 11:30 - Catherine: He has a OnePlus.
21/02/2020, 11:30 - Catherine: You can screenshot like that on there.
21/02/2020, 11:30 - Catherine: It's sexy.
21/02/2020, 11:30 - Catherine: Pig?
21/02/2020, 11:31 - Catherine: Also, his phone is just longer.
21/02/2020, 11:31 - Pablo Dent: Also samsung
21/02/2020, 11:31 - Catherine: Peg?
21/02/2020, 11:31 - Catherine: Pug?
21/02/2020, 11:31 - Catherine: Pugs are cute.
21/02/2020, 11:31 - Pablo Dent: So daniel should really know
21/02/2020, 11:31 - Pablo Dent: Literally the only other vowel
21/02/2020, 11:32 - Catherine: Pag.
21/02/2020, 11:32 - Pablo Dent: Bruv
21/02/2020, 11:32 - Pablo Dent: Ok the one other
21/02/2020, 11:32 - Catherine: sPAGhetti.
21/02/2020, 11:32 - Pablo Dent: >:(
21/02/2020, 11:32 - Catherine: Pyg.
21/02/2020, 11:33 - Tanveer: Also huawei
21/02/2020, 11:34 - Catherine: So, android phones.
21/02/2020, 11:35 - Tanveer: Hahaha, android >>>
21/02/2020, 11:36 - Daniel Batchford: no I mean how did you get a picture of your screen?
21/02/2020, 11:37 - Tanveer: He pressed the accelerator and brake pedal at the same time
21/02/2020, 11:41 - Catherine: You what.
21/02/2020, 11:42 - Pablo Dent: This should have a question mark, 0/10
21/02/2020, 11:43 - Catherine: Look ye.
21/02/2020, 11:43 - Catherine: Shup.
21/02/2020, 11:51 - Catherine: Guys, what do I get from McDonald's?
21/02/2020, 11:52 - Daniel Batchford: you had me at McDonald's 😂😂👍😂😂😂👌😂
21/02/2020, 14:30 - Michael: When u said “do” 💀💀

23/02/2020, 15:16 - Mark: Lul*
23/02/2020, 15:16 - Mark: That would be extremely broken
23/02/2020, 15:24 - Catherine: Idk, I was playing one of the modes.
23/02/2020, 15:24 - Catherine: And their hero power was like haircut or some shit.
23/02/2020, 15:25 - Catherine: And they just upgraded their 0/3 to a taunt.
23/02/2020, 15:25 - Catherine: Wait no, they stealthed it first.
23/02/2020, 15:25 - Catherine: Then taunt.
23/02/2020, 15:25 - Catherine: And I was like.
23/02/2020, 15:25 - Catherine: Dafuq am I meant to do?
23/02/2020, 15:27 - Mark: Win?
23/02/2020, 15:30 - Catherine: I did, but that's besides the point.
23/02/2020, 16:28 - Catherine: https://youtu.be/ChGgp54QPL0
23/02/2020, 16:35 - Eito Miyamura: You can ignore them
23/02/2020, 16:41 - Mark: Its like shes pooping
23/02/2020, 16:50 - Catherine: Wait, so I can just attack other things?
23/02/2020, 16:50 - Mark: Yes
23/02/2020, 16:50 - Mark: .
23/02/2020, 16:51 - Eito Miyamura: Ye
23/02/2020, 16:52 - Catherine: That doesn't make sense.
23/02/2020, 16:52 - Catherine: Oh wait no.
23/02/2020, 16:52 - Catherine: I get it now.
23/02/2020, 21:11 - Michael: Anyone down to go bham sometime in March?
23/02/2020, 21:12 - Daniel Batchford: yeah any day is fine
23/02/2020, 21:12 - Daniel Batchford: lol
23/02/2020, 21:12 - Daniel Batchford: never been there before
23/02/2020, 21:13 - Michael: It’ll probs be a trek for u tho
23/02/2020, 21:24 - Mark: Ye its a bit too far away for me ngl
23/02/2020, 21:25 - Tanveer: Likewise :(
23/02/2020, 21:25 - Pablo Dent: I honestly can't tell if you're joking
23/02/2020, 21:38 - Eito Miyamura: hello
23/02/2020, 21:38 - Eito Miyamura: does anyone have an idea on whats the best representation for bracketing order
23/02/2020, 21:38 - Eito Miyamura: <Media omitted>
23/02/2020, 21:38 - Eito Miyamura: or smth like this
23/02/2020, 21:39 - Eito Miyamura: say for M1,M2,M3, M4,  the optimal is (M1x(M2xM3))xM4
23/02/2020, 21:39 - Eito Miyamura: how would you represent that bracket ordering, in say a list?
23/02/2020, 21:50 - Michael: Wtf is a time polynomial
23/02/2020, 21:51 - Michael: Unless the grammar in the last sentence is just messed up
23/02/2020, 21:51 - Michael: (Of the pic)
23/02/2020, 21:52 - Daniel Batchford: a problem that can be solved in polynomial time
23/02/2020, 21:53 - Michael: Ah kk
23/02/2020, 21:53 - Michael: I just googled it
23/02/2020, 22:30 - Reemon Spector: If you know the original order, rewrite the list in terms of which multiplications you do first as tuples?
23/02/2020, 22:30 - Reemon Spector: And since it's almost never commutative you won't get confused either
23/02/2020, 23:18 - Nick: <Media omitted>
23/02/2020, 23:19 - Catherine: Who the fuck made this?
23/02/2020, 23:19 - Eito Miyamura: ?
23/02/2020, 23:19 - Eito Miyamura: So how would you represent this kind of multiplication?
23/02/2020, 23:20 - Nick: its  a real move with and michael douglas is a real actor
23/02/2020, 23:20 - Reemon Spector: E.g. [1,2,3,4] --> [2,3,1,4]
23/02/2020, 23:23 - Reemon Spector: Representing it is the easy bit tho
23/02/2020, 23:24 - Reemon Spector: Idk how to find the order in poly time
23/02/2020, 23:24 - Pablo Dent: surely bracket the highest inner size product each time
23/02/2020, 23:25 - Pablo Dent: e.g. 20x50 and 50x1 gets rid of the 50x50 bit that youd have to do later
23/02/2020, 23:26 - Pablo Dent: that seems kinda not dynamic tho
23/02/2020, 23:29 - Reemon Spector: 1x101 and 101x1 is only 101 operations but 10x10 and 10x10 is like 1000 operations
23/02/2020, 23:31 - Pablo Dent: But then say you had (10x1)(1x101)(101x1)(1x10)
23/02/2020, 23:31 - Pablo Dent: Youd still wanna do the 101s first right
23/02/2020, 23:32 - Reemon Spector: Ye ofc the argument can be refined, but just inner product doesn't work on it's own
23/02/2020, 23:32 - Pablo Dent: Idk im just guessing tbh
23/02/2020, 23:33 - Pablo Dent: Whats a case where it doesnt work?
23/02/2020, 23:34 - Pablo Dent: Wait yeah i think (10x10)(10x101)(101x10)(10x10) doesn't work
23/02/2020, 23:34 - Pablo Dent: Hmm
23/02/2020, 23:34 - Reemon Spector: I miss doing maths :(
23/02/2020, 23:48 - Eito Miyamura: Nah ik how to do this
23/02/2020, 23:49 - Eito Miyamura: Ty
23/02/2020, 23:49 - Eito Miyamura: I think I get it
23/02/2020, 23:49 - Eito Miyamura: You'd do it like
23/02/2020, 23:49 - Reemon Spector: Tbh you could even make a polynomial to do it
23/02/2020, 23:50 - Eito Miyamura: Define K[j] to be the minimum time to multiply matrices
23/02/2020, 23:50 - Eito Miyamura: And then
23/02/2020, 23:50 - Mark: This is so good
23/02/2020, 23:50 - Eito Miyamura: Where j is the #of matrices you use up to
23/02/2020, 23:50 - Eito Miyamura: And then
23/02/2020, 23:51 - Eito Miyamura: You say K[j] = min(K[j-1]+ms[j-1]*ms[j], ms[j] *ms[j-1]*ms[j-2]
23/02/2020, 23:52 - Eito Miyamura: Soz I can prob explain better when I'm more sober
23/02/2020, 23:52 - Reemon Spector: ms?
23/02/2020, 23:52 - Eito Miyamura: Ms being list of matrices
23/02/2020, 23:52 - Eito Miyamura: Being described as
23/02/2020, 23:52 - Eito Miyamura: The latter hiehjt of each mamyrix
23/02/2020, 23:55 - Mark: Bruh youre missing a round bracket im gettig a compilation error in my brain
24/02/2020, 00:43 - Eito Miyamura: Go chuck yourself

24/02/2020, 01:02 - Michael: Haha get it because his mum sent him that text message did you guys get the reference 😎
24/02/2020, 01:03 - Pablo Dent: Wait no can someone tell me the reference please i dont get it arslash woooosh arslash cring
24/02/2020, 01:04 - Tanveer: It becaus Mikey your keys are at home I'll be back 530 your make sure you come home after this time! 😳🤪🙃

24/02/2020, 14:31 - Eito Miyamura: Wait, but how would you represent (M1xM2) x (M3xM4)
24/02/2020, 14:32 - Reemon Spector: [(1,2),(3,4)]
24/02/2020, 14:34 - Pablo Dent: I would say just have a tuple of the order of the multiplications
24/02/2020, 14:34 - Pablo Dent: I.e. number the multiplication signs
24/02/2020, 14:35 - Pablo Dent: And write the order they are done in
24/02/2020, 14:35 - Pablo Dent: So this would be (1,3,2) or (3,1,2)
24/02/2020, 14:37 - Pablo Dent: Cos this is basically the same as writing it out again
24/02/2020, 14:38 - Pablo Dent: And that doesnt regard order
24/02/2020, 14:51 - Eito Miyamura: Oh shit
24/02/2020, 14:51 - Eito Miyamura: Ye that's prob it
24/02/2020, 14:51 - Eito Miyamura: Thanks
24/02/2020, 14:51 - Reemon Spector: whoa that's clever
24/02/2020, 14:51 - Eito Miyamura: Ye

26/02/2020, 15:53 - Pablo Dent: Like tbh this article was kinda lazy
26/02/2020, 15:53 - Pablo Dent: They might not be the most dangerous
26/02/2020, 15:54 - Daniel Batchford: I saw an article once saying "17 secret London Underground sins"
26/02/2020, 15:54 - Daniel Batchford: and it was stuff like don't vomit on the tube
26/02/2020, 15:54 - Daniel Batchford: and don't pull the alarm
26/02/2020, 15:54 - Daniel Batchford: just dumb stuff like that

04/03/2020, 16:02 - Nick: I think it's inputted as string
04/03/2020, 16:02 - Nick: try putting int() whenever you input it
04/03/2020, 16:02 - Daniel Batchford: yeah I was gonna say that but nick copied my answer
04/03/2020, 16:03 - Nick: so do number.append(int(str(line)))
04/03/2020, 16:03 - Nick: or numbers.append(int(line)) if that works idk python any more
04/03/2020, 16:04 - +44 7367 504418: Where to put this

07/03/2020, 13:17 - Tanveer: Foo
08/03/2020, 08:19 - Reemon Spector: Anyone up to help with maths
08/03/2020, 08:20 - Mark: Go o  then
08/03/2020, 08:32 - Reemon Spector: Oblique collision of 2 objects, I have the initial velocities and masses and directions
08/03/2020, 08:33 - Reemon Spector: And when I start doing the algebra I use PCLM and conservation of energy
08/03/2020, 08:33 - Reemon Spector: And I get an ellipse of solutions
08/03/2020, 08:33 - Reemon Spector: So I need a line thing to intersect it?
08/03/2020, 08:34 - Reemon Spector: But idk where the line equation comes from :(
08/03/2020, 08:35 - Mark: Uuuj
08/03/2020, 08:35 - Mark: Ok you lost me lul
08/03/2020, 08:36 - Reemon Spector: Dm
08/03/2020, 09:47 - Eito Miyamura: You need the newton's experimental law don't you?
08/03/2020, 09:48 - Eito Miyamura: That's the last bit that solves it
08/03/2020, 09:48 - Eito Miyamura: Using e = sep speed/appr speed
08/03/2020, 09:54 - Reemon Spector: OHH I'm dumb
08/03/2020, 09:54 - Reemon Spector: I thought if that's always 1 it's fine
08/03/2020, 09:55 - Reemon Spector: Ty
08/03/2020, 09:55 - Eito Miyamura: Nw xd
08/03/2020, 09:56 - Eito Miyamura: If that's 1 I think all that it tells you is that energy is conserved or smth like that
08/03/2020, 09:56 - Eito Miyamura: Like the ke is conserved between the two particles
08/03/2020, 09:58 - Bence: This is true
08/03/2020, 10:01 - Bence: @447943649642 oblique collisions can usually be most easily solved by transforming into the zero momentum frame (the frame in which the centre of mass of the system is stationary), then using NEL, and then going back to the original frame and doing some geometry (usually a lot of cosine rule stuff)
08/03/2020, 16:26 - Eito Miyamura: Help
08/03/2020, 16:26 - Eito Miyamura: Does anyone know why
08/03/2020, 16:28 - Reemon Spector: Because
08/03/2020, 16:29 - Eito Miyamura: If you have f: [a, b] -> R, be convex, differentiable, strictly decreasing, with f(b) < 0

And x0 is in [a, b) with f(x0) >= 0, then with Newton method the sequence of xn (x0, x1, x2,...) is an increasing sequence that converges to root of f
08/03/2020, 16:29 - Reemon Spector: Algebra wasn't the problem, but now it's fine
08/03/2020, 16:35 - Eito Miyamura: It should just be algebraic manipulation but I'm too dumb :((
08/03/2020, 17:44 - Reemon Spector: Define convex?
08/03/2020, 17:44 - Reemon Spector: f'' > 0 forall x?
08/03/2020, 17:53 - Reemon Spector: This might come in useful, I'm struggling to define the modulus of elasticity (e=sep/app) in terms of momentum
08/03/2020, 17:54 - Bence: I think it only work in the ZMF, because there your separation and approach velocities are guaranteed to be along the same line
08/03/2020, 17:54 - Bence: *works
08/03/2020, 17:54 - Eito Miyamura: yes
08/03/2020, 17:54 - Reemon Spector: Oooooh
08/03/2020, 17:56 - Eito Miyamura: a lemma also tells you that statement is equivelant to
08/03/2020, 17:56 - Eito Miyamura: <Media omitted>
08/03/2020, 18:01 - Reemon Spector: When u say converges are you using the whole forall epsilon therexists an n_epsilon... ?
08/03/2020, 18:03 - Eito Miyamura: converge in this context means
08/03/2020, 18:03 - Eito Miyamura: if e_n is the error at nth step
08/03/2020, 18:03 - Eito Miyamura: (e_n+1)/(e_n) -> 1
08/03/2020, 18:03 - Eito Miyamura: as n -> inf
08/03/2020, 18:04 - Eito Miyamura: the magnitude anyway
08/03/2020, 18:04 - Eito Miyamura: you can assume there is a root between with intemediate value theorem and assuming continuity
08/03/2020, 18:06 - Reemon Spector: They're equivalent tho, right?
08/03/2020, 18:08 - Eito Miyamura: what is?
08/03/2020, 18:10 - Reemon Spector: e_n+1/error_n -> 1 <=> forall epsilon...
08/03/2020, 18:11 - Eito Miyamura: I'd assume so but its hardcore analysis shit
08/03/2020, 18:20 - Reemon Spector: <Media omitted>
08/03/2020, 18:21 - Reemon Spector: You might be able to utilise that f'' > 0 and that (x_n+1)^2 < x_n+1 for x_n+1 < 1
08/03/2020, 18:22 - Eito Miyamura: wait wat
08/03/2020, 18:22 - Eito Miyamura: where does that come from
08/03/2020, 18:22 - Reemon Spector: Chain rule
08/03/2020, 18:23 - Reemon Spector: x_n+1 = f'(x_n)/f(x_n)
08/03/2020, 18:23 - Reemon Spector: Do f to both sides and differentiate
08/03/2020, 18:23 - Eito Miyamura: differentiating x_n+1 = x_n - f(x_n)/f'(x_n)?
08/03/2020, 18:23 - Eito Miyamura: there's a x_n term you forgot I think
08/03/2020, 18:23 - Reemon Spector: OHHH there's an x_n - at the start
08/03/2020, 18:23 - Eito Miyamura: ye
08/03/2020, 18:23 - Reemon Spector: I'm dumb
08/03/2020, 18:24 - Reemon Spector: Wait no it's fine
08/03/2020, 18:24 - Reemon Spector: That goes to 0 anyway?
08/03/2020, 18:24 - Reemon Spector: No nvm
08/03/2020, 18:25 - Eito Miyamura: ? how'd you know
08/03/2020, 18:25 - Reemon Spector: yOu GeT 0 wHeN yOu DifFeReNtIaTe CoNsTaNtS
08/03/2020, 18:25 - Reemon Spector: Pepega as fuck
08/03/2020, 18:27 - Eito Miyamura: um
08/03/2020, 18:28 - Eito Miyamura: how do you get to that? You're differentiating wrt x_n rite
08/03/2020, 18:29 - Reemon Spector: Yah
08/03/2020, 18:30 - Reemon Spector: So that isn't f'(x_n+1), that's df(x_n+1)/dx_n
08/03/2020, 18:30 - Reemon Spector: And all you can do with that is sub in x_n+1 = ... in terms of x_n and get 0=0
08/03/2020, 18:30 - Reemon Spector: So it's useless
08/03/2020, 18:31 - Eito Miyamura: rip
08/03/2020, 18:32 - Eito Miyamura: rip I mean you know there is a root between [x0,b), so you can show x1 > x0
08/03/2020, 18:33 - Eito Miyamura: but then showing that x1 is in [a,b) is unclear
08/03/2020, 18:33 - Reemon Spector: I thought it was strictly decreasing
08/03/2020, 18:33 - Eito Miyamura: f is strictly decreasing yeah
08/03/2020, 18:34 - Eito Miyamura: f(x0) >= 0, f(b) < 0 so thats why its between [x0,b) by intermediate value thm
08/03/2020, 18:34 - Eito Miyamura: oh and uniqueness I guess
08/03/2020, 18:35 - Reemon Spector: So x_n+1 is always gonna  > x_n until x_n+p+1 > α > x_n+p
08/03/2020, 18:36 - Eito Miyamura: but how do you know x_n+1 is always less than b
08/03/2020, 18:36 - Reemon Spector: For some p
08/03/2020, 18:36 - Reemon Spector: Coz then p is 0
08/03/2020, 18:36 - Reemon Spector: Which won't happen unless x_0 = α
08/03/2020, 18:37 - Reemon Spector: I feel like maybe I should go to the lectures before I can try doing these ngl
