I get that it literally refers to people that call desserts and stuff „Çπ„Ç§„Éº„ÉÑ in English for no reason but what is its actual usage in net slang?

Slang is hard lol
31/01/2020, 17:49 - Eito: Uhh
31/01/2020, 17:49 - Eito: Can you give me a context in which it's used?
31/01/2020, 17:50 - Chua Hou: LOL uh it's just one of the many names Okabe called kurisu by

31/01/2020, 17:53 - Eito: Yeah
31/01/2020, 17:53 - Chua Hou: Terrible choice of example oops
But it's just what he sometimes calls kurisu whenever she does something he doesn't like

31/01/2020, 17:56 - Chua Hou: So it's just making fun of ppl that do that in English for no good reason?
31/01/2020, 17:56 - Eito: Oh no
31/01/2020, 17:56 - Eito: It's more general
31/01/2020, 17:57 - Chua Hou: Ohj
31/01/2020, 17:58 - Eito: It's like a general word to describe women who are easily influenced by magazines or TV or trends and think it's fashionable
31/01/2020, 17:58 - Chua Hou: Ohhhhh
31/01/2020, 17:58 - Eito: In a mocking way similarly
31/01/2020, 17:58 - Chua Hou: Ok that makes a lot of sense
31/01/2020, 17:58 - Eito: Yeah
31/01/2020, 17:58 - Chua Hou: Thanks! Net slang is hard when the literal meaning makes sense but not enough sense xD
31/01/2020, 17:59 - Eito: Haha yeah
31/01/2020, 17:59 - Eito: Nw
31/01/2020, 19:32 - Chua Hou: <Media omitted>
31/01/2020, 19:41 - Eito: Huh how come?
31/01/2020, 19:42 - Chua Hou: Errr in the VN they don't find out about the brainwashing by going to the facility
31/01/2020, 19:42 - Chua Hou: In the VN they realise kagari has kurisu's memories
Not sure if that's still going to happen in the anime considering they merged all the different routes into 1
31/01/2020, 20:03 - Eito: Huh
31/01/2020, 20:03 - Eito: Fair idk what's going on
01/02/2020, 00:32 - Chua Hou: Sorry for the sg0 spam but it's so weird hearing daru talk like Gilgamesh lol
01/02/2020, 02:09 - Eito: Wait he does?
01/02/2020, 02:09 - Eito: Does he do the mongrel thing
01/02/2020, 02:10 - Chua Hou: Nah more like he just speaks normally lol
01/02/2020, 02:10 - Eito: Yeah
01/02/2020, 02:11 - Eito: What
01/02/2020, 02:11 - Eito: Wdym?
01/02/2020, 02:11 - Chua Hou: I mean he sounds like Gilgamesh when he speaks normally without the daru voice
01/02/2020, 02:11 - Chua Hou: Like normal daru sounds like normal gilgamesh
01/02/2020, 02:12 - Chua Hou: Tbf I'm only saying this cuz I don't think I've seen any other characters voiced by tomokazu seki lol so hearing his voice is an instant "oh it's Gilgamesh" for me
01/02/2020, 02:12 - Eito: I definitely don't see this
01/02/2020, 02:12 - Eito: Like maybe I just can't tell voice actors
01/02/2020, 02:12 - Eito: But it's definitely not the dance
01/02/2020, 02:13 - Eito: Same *
01/02/2020, 02:13 - Chua Hou: Haha I mean it's literally the same voice actor

03/02/2020, 12:39 - Chua Hou: Since the one I found is outdated and has issues with its alarm features
03/02/2020, 12:39 - Chua Hou: I thought it'd be a fun exercise in app programming
03/02/2020, 12:40 - Chua Hou: But android 10 is very annoying...
03/02/2020, 12:54 - Eito: Oh god

16/02/2020, 23:02 - Chua Hou: Yeah
16/02/2020, 23:29 - Eito: wait rq
16/02/2020, 23:29 - Eito: if you like
16/02/2020, 23:29 - Eito: take away a number
16/02/2020, 23:29 - Eito: and you do say
16/02/2020, 23:29 - Eito: 0-1
16/02/2020, 23:29 - Eito: on an unsigned int
16/02/2020, 23:29 - Eito: you get a carry right?
16/02/2020, 23:31 - Chua Hou: How do you intend to do 0-1 on an unsigned int?
16/02/2020, 23:31 - Eito: no as in
16/02/2020, 23:31 - Eito: like
16/02/2020, 23:31 - Chua Hou: That's just 0+MaxInt if you think of it as unsigned
16/02/2020, 23:31 - Eito: if r0 = 0
16/02/2020, 23:31 - Eito: and you try do
16/02/2020, 23:31 - Eito: subs r0, r0, #1
16/02/2020, 23:32 - Eito: then is it v=1
16/02/2020, 23:32 - Eito: ?
16/02/2020, 23:32 - Eito: or c=1
16/02/2020, 23:32 - Chua Hou: That's adds r0, r0, 2s complement of 1
16/02/2020, 23:32 - Chua Hou: Errr let me check on the flags
16/02/2020, 23:33 - Eito: oh wait
16/02/2020, 23:33 - Eito: I think its the n flag
16/02/2020, 23:33 - Chua Hou: Yes N flag is set
16/02/2020, 23:33 - Chua Hou: Z defo no
16/02/2020, 23:33 - Chua Hou: C is not set
16/02/2020, 23:33 - Chua Hou: V is not set
16/02/2020, 23:33 - Eito: yes
16/02/2020, 23:33 - Eito: so its n=1
16/02/2020, 23:33 - Eito: so I can use conditional branches on n
16/02/2020, 23:33 - Eito: kk ty
16/02/2020, 23:33 - Chua Hou: Yes
16/02/2020, 23:34 - Chua Hou: The processor doesn't care about signed or unsigned
16/02/2020, 23:34 - Chua Hou: It's how you interpret the numbers that makes the difference between signed and unsigned
16/02/2020, 23:34 - Eito: ah I see
16/02/2020, 23:34 - Eito: kewl
16/02/2020, 23:34 - Eito: ty
16/02/2020, 23:34 - Chua Hou: Doing subs r0, r0, #1 only performs the operation of 0x00000000 + 0xFFFFFFFF
16/02/2020, 23:47 - Eito: yeah
16/02/2020, 23:47 - Eito: makes sense
16/02/2020, 23:47 - Eito: also

17/02/2020, 00:01 - Chua Hou: Errr
17/02/2020, 00:02 - Chua Hou: I just said that the hidden register must be ensured to be pushed when interrupt is called to prevent undefined behavuour by the interrupt handler overwriting it
17/02/2020, 00:04 - Eito: Fair
17/02/2020, 00:04 - Eito: Cool thanks
17/02/2020, 00:04 - Eito: I think I'll just leave it blank bcuz I dunno
17/02/2020, 00:12 - Chua Hou: Just read up a bit about the next chapter on interrupts and it'll make sense haha

14/03/2020, 23:38 - Chua Hou: Unfortunately I don't know any such books
14/03/2020, 23:38 - Chua Hou: Try looking for resources that start you off on binary logic and gates and brings you up to how adders and memory and processors work (e.g. pipeline) if you really want the appreciation
14/03/2020, 23:39 - Chua Hou: Tho if I'm not wrong that happens in the computer architecture course next year
15/03/2020, 14:07 - Eito: okay coolo

20/03/2020, 04:23 - Eito: Bedrock
20/03/2020, 04:23 - Eito: Haven't started yet though lol
20/03/2020, 04:24 - Eito: Also because I'm addictied to dark souls
20/03/2020, 06:32 - Chua Hou: Ohhh haha

21/03/2020, 02:40 - Eito: Oh right
21/03/2020, 02:40 - Eito: I forgot they made it free
21/03/2020, 02:40 - Eito: Ew guns
21/03/2020, 02:41 - Eito: It's all about the sword life üò§
21/03/2020, 03:25 - Chua Hou: Hahahahaha
21/03/2020, 03:25 - Chua Hou: Why swing swords in games when you can swing swords irl
21/03/2020, 03:25 - Chua Hou: (not ATM tho)
21/03/2020, 03:34 - Eito: True xd
21/03/2020, 03:34 - Eito: My issue is prob that I'm not trained enough
21/03/2020, 03:37 - Eito: As in strength wise
21/03/2020, 03:37 - Eito: Ok so interesting question asked
21/03/2020, 03:38 - Eito: Do you think existence of oneself is based on physical manifestation
21/03/2020, 03:38 - Eito: I. E. If i quantum teleport, is that still me
21/03/2020, 03:45 - Chua Hou: Hahaha no need strength
Firefights take more str ngl
21/03/2020, 03:45 - Chua Hou: Hmm
21/03/2020, 03:45 - Chua Hou: Personally I go by the "if it's indistinguishable by all actions then it's the same thing"
21/03/2020, 03:45 - Chua Hou: So yes
21/03/2020, 03:51 - Eito: Huh
21/03/2020, 03:51 - Eito: Never knew that lol
21/03/2020, 03:52 - Eito: To hold back recoil?
21/03/2020, 03:52 - Chua Hou: 2 handed swords in general require very little strength
21/03/2020, 03:52 - Eito: Fairs
21/03/2020, 03:52 - Chua Hou: No to run around and change position lol
21/03/2020, 03:52 - Chua Hou: You need to move a lot more for a gunfight than a swordfight
21/03/2020, 03:52 - Chua Hou: Ok tbf that's a bit wrong
21/03/2020, 03:52 - Chua Hou: Depends heavily on format of the fight
21/03/2020, 03:59 - Chua Hou: Also I've never fought with a sword with combat armour (only with fencing armour which is arguably worse but better in different ways)
21/03/2020, 03:59 - Chua Hou: And it's a lot easier to hold up a sword than a gun for long times lol
21/03/2020, 04:01 - Eito: Even if you consider that you get deconstructed on an atomic level, where the particles are sent over one by one?
21/03/2020, 04:01 - Eito: Or if your exact copy is built with different particles, but in the same configuration
21/03/2020, 04:01 - Eito: Fair
21/03/2020, 04:01 - Eito: Cuz it's a rod?
21/03/2020, 04:03 - Chua Hou: Yep
21/03/2020, 04:03 - Chua Hou: Assuming you maintain function
21/03/2020, 04:03 - Chua Hou: Since you consider an exact same copy with the same configuration
21/03/2020, 04:04 - Chua Hou: Of course this is something I am basing on what feels right lol
May change if I study mord
21/03/2020, 04:04 - Chua Hou: It's like 1/3 the weight or less usually lol
21/03/2020, 04:05 - Chua Hou: My longsword: 1.2kg
