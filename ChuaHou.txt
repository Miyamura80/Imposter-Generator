Dying at まゆしいのバナナ
Hahaha
Japan loves their crossovers too much
Indeed
This Singaporean company is absolutely mad
Hahaha
It's within budget to make one if you venture on eBay... But I don't trust my ability to make one
I'd rather program a rpi and display to show one Lol
*LOL
That's why I said on a display lol
Although and RPI is definitely more than enough to program actual Nixie tubes
My friend sent me an interesting puzzle I thought you might be interested in
Bruh
Ep 8
(ノT＿T)ノ ＾┻━┻
Why's there always Japanese in the ugsa
Undergraduate social area
The one near here
イリアさん triggered by イリヤ
The timeslots you wanted to exchange are for ds?
Ok my DS is wed 5–6
Yes
10.45
Our cm isn't being moved to wed 5–6
Most likely odd weeks Tuesdays 2–3
Oh man `cmp` and `AddWithCarry` are melting my mind
😭
Errr it just melted my brain a bit trying to wrap my head around the carry and overflows in the different cases for signed and unsigned
It's nothing too hard
Ah oh man this sat of all sats is welcome back drinks for singsoc :(
Who you going pub with?
Ah sads
Hahaha
I miss being back in hostel where we would chill together and do our own stuff while in the same room
Too bad I only really started doing that in the last few weeks of hostel
(Context: in my high school in fifth year we stay in hostel instead of going home everyday)
Hahaha
There were indeed quite a few parties and all
Not by UK standards tho
What's going on LOL
What's with that lighting
Oh nice LOL
There are at least 2 separate Japanese high schools wandering around Oxford today LOL
Fri 16.45
WK 8
Np!
Continuing my asking for help in Japanese, what does スイーツ（笑） mean in usage?
LOL uh it's just one of the many names Okabe called kurisu by
Like
め being the め from like バカめ
And が just being like the particle が
Terrible choice of example oops
Oh no as in he literally says スイーツかっこわらい
Like https://ja.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%BC%E3%83%84%EF%BC%88%E7%AC%91%EF%BC%89
菓子やデザートなどの甘味を「スイーツ」[1]と勿体ぶって呼称するような日本人女性のことを意味する[2][3]日本のインターネットスラング。
So it's just making fun of ppl that do that in English for no good reason?
Ohj
Ohhhhh
Ok that makes a lot of sense
Thanks! Net slang is hard when the literal meaning makes sense but not enough sense xD
Errr in the VN they don't find out about the brainwashing by going to the facility
In the VN they realise kagari has kurisu's memories
Sorry for the sg0 spam but it's so weird hearing daru talk like Gilgamesh lol
Nah more like he just speaks normally lol
I mean he sounds like Gilgamesh when he speaks normally without the daru voice
Like normal daru sounds like normal gilgamesh
Tbf I'm only saying this cuz I don't think I've seen any other characters voiced by tomokazu seki lol so hearing his voice is an instant "oh it's Gilgamesh" for me
Haha I mean it's literally the same voice actor
Flavius said you passed by my room at 3? 😂
Haha
omega??
Haha
Since the one I found is outdated and has issues with its alarm features
I thought it'd be a fun exercise in app programming
But android 10 is very annoying...
Hahaha
Lemme show you when I see you
I think it's not bad
Why were you coming over tho
As in why did you pass by
Ah haha
When did your friends stay till?
Oh haha
HAHAHAHHAA
Digital systems?
Oh
7 mine was like
Interesting
LOL
LOL
Yup same
Yep
I wrote the program in c beforehand
Haha
Hahaha
Did you test
LOL
Have you done daa
Lol I'll start after dinner
Haha same
I finally got my textbook btw
Of all places to work xD
I probably won't since I'm gonna shower first
Oh
Interesting
Hey do you know what black tie means in Oxford specifically
Ah
Do you think I'll be fine with matriculation level stuff lol
I need to get a black tie
Oh
Is white bow tie fine too then
Probably right
Do you know this anime
Oh nice
Nice
:(
Guess I'll buy a tie then
Hahaha indeed
It is nice
It's a random screenshot of daru hacking
Btw did you mean definitely not the same VA or definitely not sounding similarly
Yeah lol but specifically trying each length
LOL
I still can't believe they have the same VA
It was more believable in the VN cuz by the time the anime was made the VA made his voice even more exaggerated
Sure
Amazing
See you at 8 +- some
Almost done
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa my head
I thought スーパーハカー was the wrong one and スーパーハッカー was the correct one :o
Ah crap I totally missed your message :(
Hope you guys had fun!
I'm just doing my Japanese project now lol
Honestly I only know half of them thanks to daru lol
Haha
Yeah haha
How do you say "insult" in Japanese
Ah nice
Sure
Where when
Ok
Meet where
Yo where go
Ok so I go to Christ church?
Ok
My jackets are in your room and the rest left while I went to the toilet so can I pick them up tmr morning?
Oh damn you're awake
Could I go over now then
Ok be right there
Missed voice call
Yo quick question for 2.3(a)
Do you start from the sums and make into the form of vector or start from vector and show it's equivalent
Nvm got it
Oya do you have my IP notes
Ah okay np
Thanks anyway
Ah okay thanks!
Haha
It's all lame stuff explained badly
Also sure lol
Fair haha
Oh my gos
This was a mistake
I can't believe we both missed our tut
This is bad
I cannot apologize over email fast enough
Lance and I both missed...
He's in more trouble than me
standa emailed me saying "this doesnt sound like you"
Standa emailed him with an appointment with Dr lumbers
Aaa feels bad he seems stressed
It's still a big unacceptable thing tho
I'm half expecting myself to get charged LOL
Thank god for no military law
😅
Errr
extra duties, confinement, stoppage of leave, jail, strip of rank, strip of honours, more jail
In increasing order of severity
(-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩___-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩-̩̩̩)
Err are you come now or later
Yeah lol
Just like I didn't hear my alarm
Grrrr
Oh god because I just did the presentation today I just imagined Standa and Matthew being like
駄目だこいつ
Lol ya
It's only happened twice but Standa's like "he's overslept 10 times"
Binary ? Lol
😅
Sure thing
Your room?
Be there in a bit
LOL
He says you forgot him for the 4th time
Oh no did sth happen?
Hahaha "Josh"
Last term yes LOL
That's what I started calling him joshvat
HAHAHHA
It's not
Maybe you'll remember it if you've seen it written down
It's shashvat
Haha cool
HAHAHAHA it's quite funny tho
LOL
Guess you can't specify who
LOL
Welps
You mean "CH" or my full name?
LOL
You knew me as the fate dude probabyl
Hahaha xD
Yeah
That's true
Any chance you've done daa btw?
Dammir
You guys have it due Tues right
Flav and I have it Mon :(
Yeah but at least DS is done
I'm still having trouble with recurrences :/
Yeah
How do you intend to do 0-1 on an unsigned int?
That's just 0+MaxInt if you think of it as unsigned
That's adds r0, r0, 2s complement of 1
Errr let me check on the flags
Yes N flag is set
Z defo no
C is not set
V is not set
Yes
The processor doesn't care about signed or unsigned
It's how you interpret the numbers that makes the difference between signed and unsigned
Doing subs r0, r0, #1 only performs the operation of 0x00000000 + 0xFFFFFFFF
Errr
I just said that the hidden register must be ensured to be pushed when interrupt is called to prevent undefined behavuour by the interrupt handler overwriting it
Just read up a bit about the next chapter on interrupts and it'll make sense haha
😭😭😭😭
Eh that's just what I was typing during the lecture lol
Of course
You alright? Or were you doing daa lol
LOL you probably mean "the latter lol" but "the later loo" is hilarious
Got your notes
(;;;・_・)
Yes certainly
Haha nice
Also I have a new bottle of Русский Стандарт so that's a yay
Wah hahaha
Sure
Ooooo
Cute
Why write documentation for your future self if you can write it for your past self
When / where is it :O
Ah Saturday might be... Hard
Can you let me know what daa covers today
LOL
Oops
Hahaha true
😭
Yeah I have haha
Oh LOL
I did N3
Yes
:/
I had a great plan for dinner but guess not
LOL I meant I had planned my time to eat hall dinner and come back and do certain things like shower and then do practice questions but now my schedule is ruined by the fact that hall dinner is takeaway
LOL
Jlpt multiple choice anyway
Maybe haha
When's that lol
I should stop eating too late OTL
Same as orz https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/orz
Haha nah then that's too late for me
Apparently that's what expected? :O
*that's what is expected
According to flav and reino
Ohhh that's what you meant
Sorry I am bad at parsing human language
I'm hungry as fuck... Should I buy chips...
Sry LOL I bought chips and am eating it while watching anime nao
Tanaka-kun wa itsumo kedaruge
Meaning Sunday night or Monday night?
If Sunday night then depends
Suree
On a whim I looked up the price of Russian standard in Singapore
I think I can buy max 1L alcohol in duty free haha
Any idea what time you wanna do the thing tonight? :O
Sureee
Umm
Ah okay
Thought you were dying or sth
Was actly gonna make sure you were alive when I got back to college lol
Anyway I am 2 mins from college let me take a quick shower then I will head over
Cuz I can predict I will be lazy to shower aftee
Ah I see now that you meant kk

Ah ok good
Also I plan to go for IP LOL
がんばります

Also thanks for this
Sry I don't know yet
Yes
Disgusting algebra
Just whack LOL
And then limit will make it simple
Seems similar enough
Wait
I used disgusting method to show that epsilon N+1 / epsilon N is 1
Then because of that I did the logarithmic with the 4 terms after taking out V
Haha yeah I've been seeing photos of it
It's tea-based alcohol from Slovakia
Hahaha
Certainly not my drink of choice but I definitely want to try it at least once in my life
LOL
Omg

Both tbh
LOL
Not yet haha

Heh
Early deadlines are good after they're over 🙆‍♂
👍
Wait why does Q6 take a long time again
Ah okay
I'm finding it hard too now but I just wanted to make sure there wasn't some catch I was missing
I think it's probably correct
Hahaha nice
I did it on paper LOL
Yeah
Wait let me login to WhatsApp wev
I just keep a DP table of size (n, n)
Table[i, j] represents the best order of multiplication for M_i to M_j

Haha that's good
How much sleep

(Dw not fever kind of unwell just tired kind of unwell)
Hahaha
Apparently there's a case in LMH too now
No idea lol
Oxford is small and dense
I'm surprised compsci is not doing anything at all
Not even suspending lectures or whatever
No I mean oxford uni in general
But I'm only specifically talking about compsci because that's the one that involves us lol
My roommate's lectures have all been cancelled alr lol
english
LOL
?
I'm just responding to this LOL
you need to write in assembly
a procedure that takes the interrupt, call a C-language handler, and then execute rti
Np
How's it going
Rip stuck where?
Ask some questions now and I'll try to help
Soon I'll be asleep so
Lol my answer is 3 lines tho
I'm not sure if correct
```asm_handler:
LOL
I think it's correct at leasr
Wdym
Wdym by how was it
Mainly just look at serial_init
And uart_handler
And do the analogous things for rng
Ok I'm gonna sleep since tut is 9am
Lab 3 instructions
Look at those too
The optional exercises
There is a link to the reference for the RNG
Yep haha
Rip lol time to study over vac
as I need to study for like probability lol
Yeah
Mainly the fact that it's from maths LOL
🐡
Eh waht
Sure!
Sry, not today. Am a bit too tired from dealing with a lot of stuff
orz
Kinda
What's up
Ahh okay
Same to you tho
Aw man missed that :(
See you soon tho!
99.7% chance I'm fleeing this country btw
Ya
I got approval to go back
Nah dude you helped me a lot with maths
Haha yeah
Rip tho
All the Singaporeans with a spine bought their tickets yesterday
Then I only got approval today so I only bought today
Yeah...
Unfortunately I don't know any such books
Try looking for resources that start you off on binary logic and gates and brings you up to how adders and memory and processors work (e.g. pipeline) if you really want the appreciation
Tho if I'm not wrong that happens in the computer architecture course next year
Haha yeah
Try it out
Who did this LOL
Oh LOL
Nice
Haha I arrived a few hours before the start of stay home notices
Not yet haha
But a lot of companies are pulling their scholars home
I get my flight comped hehe
Yeah lol
Aaaaa
Omg lol
So cute
Yaaaaa it's so good
Yeah I do lol
Was readdicted during winter vac
Niceeeee
Am quite rusty but would love to
Ohhh haha
Lol me with tarkov
Also recently started getting into zero escape again
It's the pew pew game
Isn't it free lol
Hahahahaha
Why swing swords in games when you can swing swords irl
(not ATM tho)
Hahaha no need strength
Hmm
Personally I go by the "if it's indistinguishable by all actions then it's the same thing"
So yes
2 handed swords in general require very little strength
No to run around and change position lol
You need to move a lot more for a gunfight than a swordfight
Ok tbf that's a bit wrong
Depends heavily on format of the fight
Also I've never fought with a sword with combat armour (only with fencing armour which is arguably worse but better in different ways)
And it's a lot easier to hold up a sword than a gun for long times lol
Yep
Assuming you maintain function
Since you consider an exact same copy with the same configuration
Of course this is something I am basing on what feels right lol
It's like 1/3 the weight or less usually lol
My longsword: 1.2kg
Oh fuck LOL
More*
Nice
Oh my god you guys
Hahaha I think I may only be able to join next week
Haha sure
Who else is on?
Ooo
Is Jenson from our college
Aaaa
Haha dude
Go sleep
11:49 haha
Rip
How has your sleep been
LOL
Well that's not too bad I guess lol
Hahaha
I found the best way to do that is to stay awake for longer rather than sleep for longer
Oooo nice thanks
Wtf
LOL
HAHAHHAHAA
Gold
What architecture
Nice
Oh my god LOLOL
Quality
HAHAHAHA
Naruto
It's in your thing
Hahahhaa
ai
Hahaha
