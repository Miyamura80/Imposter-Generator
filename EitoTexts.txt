In fact one of them was older
No manuj 😂😂
Umm it was just me being dumb
No I didn't
LITERALLY never said anything indicative of pedo

Cuz it's obvious
Anyway

You are tho
Tbf I had a really bad time when I thought Nahome was imi and imi was Nahome

Oof

Dw you're "too old" according to your accusations
I didn't mean it that way xd
Ffs
I'm not a pedophile
I just like cute things ffs
It's so sad tbh
I will be more responsible and edgy next year
Babies are cute yes but not in a wrong way
I just want to pat cute things and not do any more
I would only fuck someone 16+
Years btw not month
That's legit normal
I don't think anyone would like to admit not following that at this age
That policy ^

Cuz then we can roast marshmallows or something
Rip
Yeah but that's a bit shit
It's kinda just like a silver tray with charcoal inside
Which I was gunna use with ppl from my school to burn stuff
I don't think that's a good idea

That's like saying you're not a terrorist if you get caught with a bomb and you fail your mission
Yea fair point I'll probably hold off on it
Beautiful

That's pretty kinky I guess
I'm gud
Cuz I'm not a rapist

I feel like this is the most fair poll I've ever seen
Oo

OH RIGHT

No y12 from my ends
Ма нэм Гефф
Shit I forgot that's a g
You gotta read and learn
Did you guys start playing against random people?
Makes sense
What's wrong with that tho
Who knows
Nw she's not 2D so you don't need to worry
No sir
I exclusively like cute 2D characters and cute 3D girls of consensual age
Well
Hey I never said anything yet
I suppose yes, since they're not in the real world so it doesn't concern the government
Although it is morally I just
Injust*
But the 2D government is inconsistent
Hey I never said anything about underage material
I said yes to non-consensual
Underage shit is degenerative if it is porn
???
Literally never said anything about lolis
I just said I like cute anime girls
Well see
It's a gray moral area
If you think about it, if there are less rapists in the world because of rape hentai then I think it's okay
Yeah
In reality
There is less
Because people know that it fucks peoples lungs
Look ye
If people didn't constantly go on about how smoking is bad everyone would be smoking unless they have asthma
No
I never said this
I said non consensual material's existence is justified but not a morally white one
Yes it does
Because look ye
Rape hentai is like vape
It's still bad for you
But it's better than doing the real thing
Not by intention but yes
I will stop
But
I'm not a criminal
Tell me one criminal thing I've done nick
Literally no tho
OK this I admit
No?
Are you implying you're going there too
What have you done @447769118570
Hmm
OK fyne
That aside
Nick you climbed up that artwork
Nick you've smoked weed
Underage drinking
Uhh
This is defo illegal nick 😂😂
Also fake id
I mean sure but strictly speaking
Wut
I thought it was non official legalisation
As in its still illegal but police pretends not to care
Well that solves it
We're all legal
End of convo
Also whoever has that gc picture send it to me pls
Pretty sure illegal in Japan too
Would rather not

So no I didn't film anything in Japan
I'm not gay
I'm straight as a ruler irl
No u
This isn't a ruler
Also @447902093934 do you have that picture of me with sunglasses?
Untrue
You can force me to sit on a chair while watching gay porn and I bet you I won't even lift an inch
So I'm straight.
It's a figure of words
Who?
Fair
I'd say yes *if and only if* he is heterosexual
Cool then I am as straight as he is
Well you lied so
I didn't get baited
Well I'm not him then
I'm not Jacob
This is also not true
No magic Mike 😂😂

Nvm I'm wrong
Wait
The last 2 are wrong one sec
There
Michael do I pass
Nah Daniel I'm not at core Xd
Although I'd be down to do it in core
It's roughly right ish?
I think my answer is fine
Michael do I get a bottle of vodka now?
More or less yeah
I feel scammed
Pablo it's not
Between 1/3 and 1 it's concave
No it is
It's just
It goes concavey until inflection
I thought it was weird it'd be concave when there's inflection too but it makes sense
I mean I posted a solution :(
Wow this is such a scam
Michael how can you :((
I'll get it on Friday so it's fine
Or like, whenever I see you Michael xd
Yesterday was quite bad when I came home :(
At night I had the worst stomachache and pretty sure it's cuz of spice or alcohol
What is Catherine's band name and what time is it?
Sounds cool
Hash browns
Gone wrong
Only one of them even vaguely looked like one and the other ones kinda just was potato bits
I did xd
They actually tasted quite good
But now onto trying something with rice and onions
Probably will burn the rice but oh well
If I get into jesus oh boi will I cause many fire alarms
Soy milk risotto
?
Wut
What
I'm so baffled
Wait, so why did hh shut down?
Not enough of em?
Trebuchet memes are great
Lovely
Guys, for whoever was organising the Spain trip, when are we going from?
Are we actually?
Ye
I was just wondering cuz I was gonna plan another thing  and I want to go to Spain or wherever this time
Are we going right after school ends?
Ye Spain gud for summer
Wait what
I mean
I guess that's possible
Is it doe
Ah
True
Okay fine maybe not those days then
True but
Like cmon it's the final exam and it's not even physics
Anyway so
Do we go straight after the final then
But Spain is gud
Tbf if we can go Russia I'd be quite down with that too
But I think Spain is better for summer
What'd we do if we can't go Spain or EU countries tho
Isn't spain not too bad
Like, cologne was possible
Tbf we're probably gonna take coach if we're going UK
Tbh this will be me
Inb4 meltdown
Yeah so @447985365567 can you do Spain?
Okay yeah tbf it is quite pricy
Even on inspection
Would anyone like to do another European country
Italy maybe
?
Italy is quite nice
Italy is quite good
It's warm
It has seas
Good pizza and pasta
Ah fair
That could be a good?
Italy is just a nice place in general maybe minus some of the dodgy parts
Ye but like thing I don't like about Italy is the number of people who sell you dodgy shit or be annoying to you in streets ~I say this cuz I got scammed once~
See the Bulgarian knows
Ever heard of a Bulgarian who is wrong?
I'm fine with Italy too if majority of us can go?
👌
Can we go to your house?
And yeah Bulgaria sounds good ik the beaches there are great
Ah is that what you meant by free accommodation?
And ooo that sounds cool
Id be down with Bulgaria + cheap alcohol
At least, as far as ik?
Sounds good
Who is going/interested in going btw @everyone?
Me, magic Mike, Sian, Mark atm?
And also when would you like it to be? To everyone who's coming
Like straight after?
Acc, I'll create a separate chat for it so pm me if you're going to the trip/might be going
India is hella far xd
I mean Michael doesn't have discord
Are you in btw Pablo?
Yeah but like it's probably also useful when we are there
I reckon we should probably start now tho for cheaper stuff?
Idk I also just wanna know when it is earlier
@447943649642
Bence how are you still awake xd
^^
Are you thinking about what father Christmas will get you Xd
Thank you jesus
Is he in a santa costume
Getting visited by jesus?
Dissapointing
Of course xD
Omg Pablo can we do a double jesus santa costume if our dreams come true xD
Hey its not as bad as Andrew's costume last year
Are you guys secretly Spanish
Out of context but yes
Out of context xd
Again out of context
Also never with Miles
What
Yes
This just isn't the case
Guys
Who here
Has a big monopoly set
Like a big one at home
And if you have one can we all go play it at yours
Like some day
Pablo can we go to yours at some point then
Nice
I have a tiny monopoly for 4 people only :/
Any ver is good tbh
Something like 2nd Jan then?
For how many people is it?
29 then @all?
7
Wait no
8
Wait @447508201438 what time? I just woke up now 😅
Alright cool, I can still make it then
😅
I just missed my train :((((
:(
It's so sad
13:05 :/
Oo?
What was it?
Thanks for the follow up 👌
Man's arms
Makes sense*
Turns out I might not be as late as I thought, only like 20 mins
@447902093934
It's in 3 stops :/
Go in without me, cuz I'll probably be a bit longer
Ye
I can just come in at any time right?
No one eats rice raw Michael
Wtf xd
It's not actually
Since I don't gamble
@447484284407
HAPPY NEW YEAR
HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE
Name a cooler person than this
Sian you still upstairs?
Come down we're leaving now
Or are you spending another night at Pablos
Omg Michael you're in the toilet?
Sure which colour
Oh god you just reminded me shit
aii its Harrison
This message was deleted
Actually, nvm
@447466471022 is sexual assault justifiable
woah
He was getting roasted by big G
This message was deleted
I mean criminal charges are just a myth ofc
The hills are too much
😂😂 That was one way to start a year
Tbf that one isn't actually illegal
North West is just better doe
Oh
Well
It's not as illegal as pirating games
I reckon so
It's all good
Well only one game
OK, acc that's not true because I used desmume
It doesn't make sense doe xd
Last time I checked H!=W xd
Cunning
@447857561969
That's a conspiracy theory
Fuck you reemon
Not even possible
Mark you're pretty gay
Thanks Pablo
Are you blank Nancy
Also miles isn't your bitch miles is your owner
Miles isn't my owner
This message was deleted
The above also applies if it's Sian
I have never shot anyone and I am not Sian
Well I just never said that did I
But we can't tell because deleted message
You are Sian
@447468428502 is for my entertainment during physics and that's it
Not at all
It's sad when all the snow around my station has been stepped on :((
North London tings
Nah this is the centre
The amount of snow you get is directly correlated with how London you are
Yeah but snow is cold so it's negative values so it makes it positive
So NW7 is best
You get the straightest line of all time
Not even a compass postcode lmao
Does that mean I'm roughly elliptical
That's a reason to make it bad
Yes
Says you
Have you guys done the final PAG
Rip
Interview but I came like 20 min early
Ty
Amazing
I was at natural history museum
Ik me and bence had to go pick you up
Beginning of y12
When we had to go pick up Manuj in Thorpe Park
I think I confused the two Eastern Europeans together
I thought it was you xd
You're in hell
Why me?
?
Oh
I am stupid xd
Happy birthday JewBoi
Did you know that Duolingo offers high valyrian but not Bulgarian
Help there's genuinely so much around edgeware
Thank you Manuj
Rip
How is the snow in hounslow
And thanks xd
Rip see this is why North is better
Also rip my train is delayed and signals are down so idk when I can get to King's 😅
Are you coming to our school for once xd
Ye Harrison have you done the physics hw
It was quite long
It's C BTW
But the weeb way is D
Yup precisely xd
Perfect
Cute
Not sure if it's great for religion tho xd
Yeah it just talked about how cute that the hamsters were starting a new religion
When and where lmao
Oh rip I won't be 18 so I can't go :(
Sounds interesting
How much for entry?
It was comfortable alright
Caught up for my sleep I missed for my double bennie
Well
That's a good point
Wait if this is the one where you lift weights it's how far the syringe went up and then you can work out work done
Oof
Mr Lawsen especially xd
Me with every physics PAG
She's a pro stalker
Anyone going to the careers event at highgate?
Oo tell me if you defo are
if you differentiate you should get a quadratic
and then get the determinant
Rip
rip I just woke up earlier
also why did Tanveer leave?
how was the park?
Mark help with CS pls
sure mb mb xd
Who did that lol
Only a bit lol
Why me
@447941531889
It was really windy around my house today
Some of my fences got blown away I think
Rip I think North London is probably worst
Can you tell us why Mr Lawsen is not the best physics teacher
Mde?
Inspector Sam's = bomb threat right?
Ah I heard it as Sam's
This I think
Probably
I mean I'm not there anymore so
Unless I have a bomb planted in my bag it's gucci
Inspirational
My favourite is : "if the past makes you want to die of regret and you're anxious of the hopeless future, by elimination the present is the happinest"
It's not wrong tho
Xd
Because I fucked up before?
Not gilgamesh lol
I also watched like 400 other anime xd
@447510847356
I learnt today that there's actually swastika graph
I think you can edit the numbers to make it more swastika like
Woah @447868179280  had glasses
What's yubo?
Fair enough
Wut
I am confusion wut
Makes sense
@447902093934 oh wait
Awww cute
What happened
dRiNk
This message was deleted
Okay let's not xd
It was a joke nw
Oof
Tragedy
"all according to plan"
Fairs
I'm late today but I came to a realization that if you phone the school telling them you'll be late every day you can get 100% punctuality 🧙‍♂️👈
I'm not wrong tho?
Oh rip I forgot about lessons
Ye but I only say that ironically
Sorry boss
Omg I never knew about this but I'm actually kind of excited
Doesn't matter tho
It's toy story
Oof
Yes
@447902093934 Sean said he was dissapointed in you for becoming an engineer
He's probably gone in a club so I don't think he'd care xd
Although he taught me some top tips on surviving uni
You forget that it's not him that gets triggered by the word xd
The legend
I don't think a wasabi would go well with this xd
Say Hello to Anna for me xd
F
No need to thank me
😂
~being Catherine~
@447943649642 tb
No lol I took that
This was specifically taken on the day you were in renew and me and Mark were waiting for you
That gud?
Yes
Censorship much rite xd
Oof
Wtf when did this happen xD
The smallest probability that its over the sig level I think
I thought critical value was the first value where its in the uh oh zone
Ye
So like A+1 is in the uh oh zone
Fairs
I guess I need to do a bit more on stats xd
I mean it is also @447769118570 aka Adolf Hitler's birthday
Omg I've been there
Omg this was such a dumb q since you had to write it in terms of x
It was not okay :((
When it says x and y
It means like distance from origin to left or up
And so you use the far that x=rcosθ, y=rsinθ
And you're given the expression for r
It's a minimum point
You kinda have to figure it out by using trig identities or plotting point
Max* but you can't tell generally
Cuz if you plug it in you get 0
Ye pt 2 especially is a bit of a weird one
I think it gets you to integrate a sinhx
SinhU
And then sub
By doing the dx = duk (coshu)
Or smth like that
I thought DEs were subsets of recurrence relations
You do the int(πy^2) dx thing but with y being the difference of the 2 functions
Makes sense
I took it as
You take 5 numbers where parts of the digits are in the range of 0-26 and then use those as indexes?
Or multiply 26 by those numbers to get indexes alternatively
How do you mod 26 16.3?
Nvm I'm dumb
Remainder 26
Like divide and get the remainder
She said 1000 tbf
190*
100*
I think it's just guess and check tbh
This is smarter xd
This is actually how I survived through these 2 years xd
Who is @4917647764509
Or @447484284407?
Ah
Happy birthday Hitler man 🎉🎉🎊🎉
420 π🧙‍♂️
What's up with the monsters Inc theme?
Fair
Nice ill try watch later
Can confirm
I just watched it and it had the fakest physics but it was unreal
I'm not sure what you're getting at Mrs Luu
No?
Why?
Dhru?
Oh you mean dhruv
Ye he's probably the biggest fan ik of marvel
As in he knows it in and out
I think if I went with him I'd be sitting through a lecture of anything I don't understand xd
I feel attacked 😫
Easily bennie
For the strongest I mean
What
The best part being how you stand up when tabs says alcohol xd
I'm playing a fun activity called physics
Xd
?
O ye no Nabihah stole it from me so she's got ownership
I didn't really "give it" to her
Than have it be taken away from me
Relatable
Oh god
Help
We're making start blah 3
This is so bad
It's now going to be a 4 year youtube francois
Franchise *
You'll need to win a bet with me then like Mark did I guess
Also why?
Makes sense
Um if its from you maybe xd
Imagine getting a you're late shirt for JP
True
In fairness I don't think he'd take most things
Reemon didn't even come though lol
Cuz he's a lazy ass
No thanks xd
Write an English essay for STEP
Or do the maths but in English
So write "solve eks squared plus five eks plus six equals zero"
Hey look I was tipsy when I wrote this
Nah xd
Me with anime videos
Will you be one of those people who bring in a calculator for gradians and degrees then
I've done the opposite
Tf is the 4th ones for
Dissapointing
Good luck
@447868179280 @447592627644 @447943649642 I'm sorry I'm going to dissapoint you since my mum forgot to put *the shirt* on wash
I've basically failed core pure and physics 3
I don't wanna come in soaked tbh
Oh shit big rip
Lmao funny joke after those physics papers
I washed my Russian fur coat at least xc
I'm glad I'm not the only disappointment here
Also, what's the proper definition of a shear?
Ik one when I see one but it had some weird definitions with shear factors
Sik ty
If its in the same direction then surely it is
Also @447491084684 the best I got this half term with detective pikachu reynolds was to rank 2 on hearthstone
I'm sorry to dissapoint you
I thought dissapointing was with double s single p
Nvm I'm disappointing
F
I actually checked the laptops we had for our access arrangements, while we couldn't use the web browsers, we could've genuinely looked up images using the word insert image feature given that the laptops were connected to the Internet
This looks really cool
Oof
Did Mr Young actually say that
I just woke up and now I can't sleep
Here's someone who self invested in himself
Oh god wtf this is so bad :((
This is so King's its great
I just want to claim that this was in response to the recruitment to the sofa of gays
My phone clearly
@447769118570 you pierce of shit
I woke up like 6 times thanks to your alarms
You won't be saying that if you were woken up 5 times last night
Grr
It was wasn't it
You used the voice command to set am alarms
An alarm*
Uh huh
Btw all my pass code has been changed now thanks to reemon mark
So it's not 18** anymore
Correct
I can't tell if the background person is James or Anna
Who?
It doesn't sound like Tab's
Yes North London is like hounslow
@447508201438 what is our current score standing
No unless I'm so bad a bottle of soju did it
Yeah what if I get like diseases from it
Oof aight well I'm satisfied with me attack I got on you at the last moment
Genius strat
Is it normal to have mouth burns after eating hot stuff
Like bibimbab that you ate an hour kind of hot
As in actually got
Hot*
I didn't have these burns earlier but it just randomly popped up
Single
Wut
Idk I feel like there's something in my mouth like idk what it is
Maybe idk I'm just sleeping for now since I got home earlier
Idk I can't see it
Only Andrew in year 14
But I assume you meant our year
~if you're a physicist physics≈maths rite~
When's this?
@447868179280 @447943649642 @447592627644 I expect you all in "the shirt" today also
@447491084684
We can prob try convince her at Kings certificate today
@447943649642 given that I'm not even at edgeware yet, what's the probability Lato will be late?
Oof okay please tell Mrs Lawsen around 12 that I'm really sorry for being the worst person alive
😓 I don't think I ever learn anything
OK I'm at *Edgware* should be there in 40-50
Wut
This was almost as bad as my star clash series but I'm also glad some clips ik which exist weren't in there 😂😂
I liked how you put some clips which were out of context to link it to the plot
Like of me and reemon
Maybe but probably not
Truth
I have a problem now where my parents are building a portfolio of who I am friends with because I've never told them about basically anyone
Cuz they just had the parents celebration evening and they met people
Doesn't the 113 basically go Brent Cross
Wait @447484284407 about me coming to yours after the school thing, is that still on
Do you remember how we helped setting up prom for year 13s last year and I tried to ask if I can join if I payed £20
Never heard of it so probably a weak bus
Wait wut
Agree even though I don't agree with the content
Oh rite
I'm not drinking but sure
I think you know the answer
Sure
Aii gud shit
I'll drink after prom, just not in it or before
Reemon you're just a leech
This message was deleted
I'm defo not going I can't even get out of bed :(
You saw me last night I had no opportunity to do so given that my parents were taking me home

I'm so confused
Btw
@447484284407 I might not go to the Y11 help thing today cuz I wanna be as healthy as possible got prom

Also, i think I'm gonna go to the venue directly from home  instead of getting food before so there was that too
Ye prob not sry
I don't wanna die tonight
When I say die, i mean actually die
Since I'm still kinda ill
Idk I caught a cold 2 days ago and I've been in bed the whole time :(

Maybe? What time does prom start
Who even is ben and asked
Alex *

Is it normal to start bleeding from your ears from blowing your nose too much
....
I mean no it just happened
But like
I'm a bit worried now
Yea
With those sandals too of course
Please wear what you were suggesting 😂👌
You will be noted in kclms history
Please don't dissapoint us Magic Mike
Guys
What's that thing called
Where you like plug one nose and you stick it into the other nose
And then it like helps remove your blocked nose
No like srsly I need it badly Rn cuz my nose is getting destroyed
Eh nvm
I'll try look for them thanks
Similar
@447508201438 does the back attack duel rule also apply during bonfire night
Sorry prob not coming btw

I can still go
But I'll get there at 9
So according to xindi she said its ending before 9 so yh
Uh*
I don't think I'm going xd

Exactly
Oh shit
Wtf

O ye I forgot about that time
Ffs
Did Simon give it to you forever?
Shit ye I think my memory is bugging
But 13LX is no more
You better bring it back to the mathsaganza @447491084684
And the reunion event
Rekt
Wait Hyde Park boat?
I am around Central today but I can't join sry Tanv
Did we say we'll all do smth on the 4th
I can't remember but I feel like I said smth
Wait are you talking about the relatively recent one
The one that was in the news a couple of years ago
I swear it did succeed
Or liek someone resigned as a result
Yeah, I just checked the president resigned
W/e
Wait Tanv
Are you still out cuz I might be able to
No
I'd be down later tonight?
Didn't you say you had a server btw?
Have you seen the expert mod pack
It looks insane cuz you gotta actually do real chemistry
With real catalysts and shit
I've played sf2
It was fkin lit
So I assume sf4 is aight too
Best one though is ones with thaumcraft
Thaumcraft is easily the best mod of all time
Aii nice
Also @447484284407 new hs expansion
You're aids
I'm there Rn
Xx
Xd*
Why would Sam call you gay
Makes sense
But like if I see someone message ^
I think I would always assume sian over Sam
Fkin addicts
How is India
Are the mosquito bites getting to you yet
Cuz
I'm not looking forward to those in Japan and I heard they're worse in India
Big thanks to global warming I guess xd
You're all insane
What have you guys been doing anyway
Wtf lol
I might play with you at one point 1h30 to beat ender dragon
Woops
@447943649642
Tbh this is more true with chrome tho?
O ye
Big rip when you get home  and it turns out you forgot your key
So you gotta wait until your parents wake up :/
Basically yes xd
I had to go home cuz I had to be at home at 9
Yes
~Hearthstone~
You can't judge a game without playing it so everyone who hasn't played hearthstone should play it
Don't you mean csgo
In all seriousness, dark souls 3
Wait how many hours was it
Damnson.jog
No u
I spent all of last night playing dark souls
Would not regret
Well no I was trying not to sleep cuz I have a 17 hour flight
(total)
In like 2h or so
8:10
Ye I am
I saw Uxbridge on the way for the first time and can confirm sian lives in an irrelevant place
Was it zoe
Loyal to the best station I like it
There was a guy who was taking a different flight (thank god) who was wearing a "hentai" shirt
Yes
Omg I'm totally making nick buy a hentai shirt in Japan
Omg I'm at Abu Dhabi so kinda relatable
Also, does anyone remember the fozzie bashing
But he did bring a watermelon this year
Also @447769118570 isn't it like 4-5 in the morning for you
Nvm I guess you're ahead in time
You're fkin shite
Also it was a great fkin side dish with my whiskey that also contained a grasshopper in it
My aunt took me out there so it was fine besides it was like less than 1.5 shots cuz they had a huge ass ice in it
They tasted funky
Also, just an afterthought, but I think I agree more and more with this idea as I eat more funky stuff
Wut
Do you mean skewed chicken
Japanese curry?
Ai I haven't been in 2 years come
Come on * is what I meant to say
Also something that's strange is
When you visit the house you grew up in 10-12 years ago
Only to find it changed to a point of no recognition
It's kinda sad in some weird ways
Yeah
But like
If you visit it
It's a really weird feeling
Cuz it's like your childhood was kinda defiled by the new
Well
You know what I mean
Isn't it like 1 for you guys
Fkin sleep
Nw I'm going to a theme park today I'm going to die
True XD
They had cheese exclusive menus
Wtf
Can you get me one in exchange for smth from Japan
:(
Are you sure you aren't just sending us the ones you got exact on
It proves that  you are the definition
Of a basic teen*
Oh shit same
How can you like cheddar over mozzarella and parmesan
See that's why your age was so high
I mean if you wanna take a flight here I can treat you xD
Since prices here are beautiful
Thank you Haytham
@447902093934
In the Toyota museum there were like circuits you can go through
I'm not there anymore lol
Maybe @447769118570 will force me there when he comes around lol
I think I'm gonna get like 10kg fatter when I come back
I've been eating 3.5-4 meals a day of like not the most healthy things
And yeah
It was under the "sports" section 😂😂
Because of the competitive aspect of rock paper scissors presumably
Total agree
Say "please respect me" to him ty
Did you inspect element on a website
I wish I can get paid for doing that tbh
It's apparently "150 times spicier than normal tobasco"
Sorry boss
I'll buy it before I leave so you can try it sometime in summer
Same ~but I might pass out because I find tobasco spicy~
I'll try buy 2 if it's not expensive
Just phone up zen and ask him to be a live Google translate
Youtube worthy?
They're lining up just too enter a shop and it's so long that they need to go all the way up the stairs and to the entrance
An anime shop for a certain publishing company
I just had enough time to look at the prom photos but
Does anyone have the recreation of the legendary chu photo
Omg I wish I took this
I just bought the switch like a few minutes ago
That's such a piss take
Ye
I got mine for cheap cuz Japan but like wouldn't have bought otherwise
What time is it in the UK
Oof
Are you and miles  actually gonna make it to Japan safe
Makes sense
Not incorrect though
Can you climb now?
Oof
I'm disappointed he didn't down the whole bowl at once
You look like the happiest and the youngest person there xd
Rip northern line :((
Rip how long do you have to stay at hospital?
Also, you did work?
Sad that it's the worst possible flavour :/
Ah OK so it's not too bad
Stay safe lol
I'm having bad time with mosquitos too
Got bitten around the number of days I've been out of the UK
Yes ofc Japanese people are Muslim
Yeah too many haha
And other pests too
Moths > Flies > Cockroaches >>>>> Mosquitos
No what is that
So I've seen some repellants but I've been too lazy to buy it
I should
We have like séances you can repel mosquitos with
It doesn't help its really sticky
The smoke from the seance repel as them away
They look like swirly things
Kinda like candles
But you burn them
Ye
I just use these when I'm at home but they still bite me other times
It's a bit of a problem
Cuz of the smoke?
.... Tbf I think it's still better than getting gatling gunned on my body
Ah yeah
I might try those mosquito bands if they sell them
Thank you sian very cool
Cars
?
What is that
But what if they go on your Raza
Face *
Yeah I saw them but they seem expensive for a repellant
It didn't work :/ I got bitten on my left cheek
Manuj be the guy who kills insects for fun
Tbf I would kill mosquitos with love
How?
Mosquitos don't exist in the UK what
😂😂
They would ask you with a formal letter before biting
Sealed in wax of course
Nile must be riddled with bites then
Did you spend it
What do you do there?
For first try
And this is part of our room 😭😭
Eito's theorem?
Yeah
Central Tokyo
Drinking at the airport until 3 is always a great way to waste time until the flights
Ye
This thing below confused me though
Because I wouldn't say they're quite accurate
I guess but I'm defo not prospecting
Agree
@447943649642 can you start the Minecraft server? My cousins are insisting they want to see the world I play in
Nvm
I thought it was reasonable time
Nothing wrong with a phat brunch
Do you not appreciate whitepool?
1,3,8 and 10 when the menu lies and puts spicy shit
Then I wouldn't be able to eat pizza
I feel majority is 8
Can you buy me that + ssd
And a USB controller
Yes pls if you can
Water cooling
!!
I thought you were going to provide a proof
Do you remember Eito's theorem on Ms Carey
To my knowledge I have 3 and the one relating to Haytham is the main one
It had a very nice shape graph too
Mb it was called that
It was called the Golden Theorem
Let's not
Mixer tier list:
Most alcohol taste bad
Make your own
Classic
I'm bored out of my mind queueing to get into a building
11am
Nah still in this country needs a nuke land
Coffee
No I'm pretty sure that's just cuz me and my friend mixed the stuff like 2 weeks ago before we drank it
So it must've fermented or some dumb shit like that
I've always avoided absinthe so idk but I agree just with ginger beer for s tier
Prob
I think it's any hard spirit that doesn't have a great flavour
How much money did you spend in HK jesus
Ah understandable
That's normal though
Yeah what everyone does that Haytham don't you know
@447943649642 nug day this year too?
Sik
Incorrect opinion
Nick you always find a way to surprise me
Isn't it like, you can't
By the time you firmed you have an obligation to accept if you make your offer
They didn't even check my ilr and only passport scan
I mean I'm not sure
Wait Manuj are you not coming back on results day?
Holy shit are you just taking a cab to school or smth
Oof oh well
Big dissapoint :(
I mean he is the person who said the n word sober
I forgot how much I liked the cold weather no sarcasm
It's so nice being able to sit indoors without AC and not sweat like shit
Oof that's in the high end for physics 😭😭
I don't think it was ever above 80
But like
Given that I forgot how spheres worked
It's not looking great
I'm basically just gunna watch anime all day today until I sleep
Oof
I'm gunna not think about FM
Same
Extra pure was a journey
So was mech minor
So was stats minor
So was core pure
.......
Welp I think I'm fucked
I usually like core pure and extra pure
I didn't this time at all
This message was deleted
Omg
I think I'm actually fucked
:((
I'll go watch anime bye
Just not true
But
Sure
Help jet lag kicking in and I can't sleep
Tips on getting sleep
:((
I don't wanna stay awake for the next however many hours
Me
I'm still jetted and can't sleep
Wtf did you do with the sdd
Congrats 🎉🎉
Now you can make your conversation with Asuka a reality @447491084684
Highest STEP 1 grade in King's as well
Someone in my college is apparently already married
I don't think they're joking
Oh no
adjustment into Haytham's course
Who is this?

Mb
Rip when 80% of the rooms in the ballot are ensuite and you get the room where you gotta share a bathroom with 6 other people
Wdym?
Waow
I have to pay the same price as the ensuite rooms although I've got a bad room
And there's another building which is a bit further but ensuite and that's even cheaper
You don't
Food payment is seoerate
Seoerate*
It was only interviews that it was free
£23.80/night
Ge
Ye*
£3.5 a meal
Wtf
That's so cheap
Even if you're sharing
I think I live like £60 per 2 days
I have like a bedroom and a living room at least
But it's also old as shit
Since its the last few parts of my college that isn't renovated yet :/
Also isn't it more since food
There's 2 rootes
Oof
My food is  like £700/week
Oof that's so far
Yeb
I meant £70
I mean assuming 3 meals a day, 3.5*3*7=73.5
You're lucky
Essentially, but it adds up
We don't have a kitchen :((
Or like 1 shitty one across the whole college
That's so good
What's in the game room?
~let's be real you know what it's going to~
Oh I think I've seen one of those in the south Kensington campus
Do you guys have like a curfew/time accommodation gates close
Cuz our one closes at 11
I swear there wasn't even that many in Warwick
Our porter closes our college gates and if you live in college you have to let them know beforehand that you'll be past 11
Yeah that's the plan
Basically I think
Um no? I've been there at that time and definitely not
This seems more reasonable
Aren't you leaving this Sunday
Ah rip
What
You should make this your student Id
I wanna do that
No I just thought it was aesthetically pleasing
Wya
Aii
Omg they had those in Hilton hotels in Japan but it was like literally inside the bath tub
I watched anime on it and it was the best Bath experience
Eh nah it was cheaper cuz we went near Christmas
~They don't air hentai on TV~
I was actually surprised by how expensive they are if you were to try get them in Japan actually
I don't know how that industry stays afloat
Yes Hilton is a name of a love hotel
It's been precisely 2 years since our exact first day of King's
That's quite mad
Mb it was 11th
My Google photos is bugging
What
Don't think so
OK maybe I'm just being retarded
Yes
Very
Ngl this is me
Maybe you're looking at Asuka
Scared of ~dissapointing~ Asuka
Turns out seafood cheese curry is really bad for your stomach
And it makes you late for a bus you were meant to take like an hour ago
Although it tastes great so would recommend
Monday is when Warwick starts though
Was he gambling at Harrow
Oh shit
I still have @447508201438 saved as Magic Mike
Although that's not your og name
Too true xd
How's Zurich
Debating
I feel like lappy is good enough to keep me sustained
Work?
Big rip
I'll do MC in like 30 min if you're still free?
Agree
I'd love a bastion with an anime girl personality
What
Is it your imperial assignment to use Linux and get used to it
Or smth like that
Fairs
Inb4 you become Peter of our year
Tbf
The Linux terminal is nice
I used it for the cyberstart problems and they had some instantly powerful pen tools
Omg 😂
I bet he was excited
What's special about arch
Peter was always right
Ip? Although I'm not free yet
Amazing
Oh lol you almost never use gui of Linux anyway
@447868179280 you on?
And rdy
Have you tried before
Fairs lmao
Kk get on channel
Makes sense
I feel like you could genuinely use Linux without gui but then again idk enough
Mainly when I ssh devices it feels pretty complete
Warwick is fun
This message was deleted
Mb wrong chat
@447902093934 @447585906916 where you guys at
I've gone outside the gates
They said I can't come back in without sian
B block rpptes
Me and Bence have now got stuck in Coventry xd
Since we were dumb and missed the bus lol
We are taking a bus
But it leaves at 20:15 so we're now going to chill in a cafe for 3 h
Ye
@people at London, do any of you happen to have a nappy for adults they don't mind giving away?
:(
I need it for a bop on the 8th
It's not for actually using it .-.
Apparently the dress theme is: "of you when you were a child"
I don't want to get arrested during freshers week
Tbf Jack from Mark's accommodation will free me if I get arrested
But still
I don't wanna have memories in jail
Soap?
Why is the soap relevant
????????
Oh
I understand
I'm just dumb lol
Although if I get sent to jail I think I'll turn into a ragdoll within the first 2 weeks
It still isn't a reason for me to go without cloths lol
Although I'm glad Jack will help
Jack is a law student at Marks accommodation
😂😂😂
Manuj you just made my day
And it's exactly what I see Jack saying too
This message was deleted
I think I am just that bored
I've been stuck in rank 1 1 star in hearthstone and haven't been able to make progress for the past 3h
Isn't that what an accommodation is
O shit nice
Nice
You know your garden is in a great state when your neighbour offers to clean it for free because they can't stand seeing it
It was a bit of a weird burn
Oyster is expiring tommorow 😭
Rip cheap travel
Guys with your expertise of uni with freshers week, what would you say I should buy/bring other than this stuff
Laundry bag
That's a good idea
Ty
Can I go to mummy mikey to get some
You have multiple mummy mikeys?
Sick ill ask then for the hentai stash
_ _ _ _ _ _    _ _ _ _
T _ _ _ _ _       M _ _ _
Bence be gay af
Also tbf I've said that to you at least 7 times
Nah its just a dumb statement xd
I wasn't even that drunk tbf
How do you have so much phat work already
Oh fairs
I was gunna say that's some intense shit lol
Big rip
What languages do you do in eth
Oof
~what % of the students in the first year are entered through language?~
Wdym?
Huh strange
Doing a subject in 2 languages and having to know technical terms for both sounds inefficient
Like I have no clue how to do any science in Japanese lol
I mean your hw sheet was English
So I assume its predominantly English
Lol that's some weird shit
Ye
Are you at Warwick Rn
Aii nice you should go meet with the Warwick gang
Yes ~not really just hearthstone and anime~
I've been putting off haskell work because it's fkin confusing
Folds make no sense
It's the day after Friday night 😂 I think you know the answer
It's like doing set theory but in programming
It feels like that one challenge people did in y12 where you try write every code in one line
Btw James if you wanna find Warwick people try Tocil accomo or Rootes
Mark Irina Dempsey are at Tocil, sian tanveer sarvan oablo at rootes
Imagine doing that but for like every code
Is that the pub near the SU
Aii
What were you all doing so late
Could've been doing integrals all night without alcohol
Or play ~f vs p~
Or just drink and dance
He left :(
Omg new Minecraft has a nether update
help
I've been trying it for a while but I can't get the conditions
@447443576939 come to ox bence is going tommorow and I'm going in 2 days
Ah rip
Is your college allowed overnight guests
Making bad choices in life essentially
Same can be said to you though xd
Sounds very healthy way to go through 2nd week of uni xd
I haven't drank in about 7 days I think so I'm quite proud
Ye you should go sleep though xd
Dunno
Mines dodgy about it
Packing efficiency 700%
I don't think I can brush my teeth anymore
Wtf 😂😂😂
That's some insane shit
What gave you the idea to dress in such
@447508201438 are you going tryouts for university challenge?
You would so do great
Nah but people are signing up to go for the tryouts
The ones here are so much better than London ones too, they don't run away from you unless you try touch them
Yeah they have a nest in our quad
OMFG I can join the hearthstone esports team
Fuck yeah
Well it's just a University team
There was a guy passionate about hs as much as I was too and he said we fight against other uni teams for hearthstone
Legend
I didn't ask rank
Oh no they have a Marxist society next to the socialism society
Yes I love being Chinese
In fairness
A bunch of people just assume I'm an international student from China since like  STEM subjects students are mostly international and Chinese
Also in what context has this happened
Chinese apparently
I haven't actually needed to because people ask where you are from usually to account for international
Please don't
Yeah but then I tell them I'm originally from Japan
It's so sad though only like 2 people in my college like anime and they're filthy casuals
I'm gonna try wear a very explicit anime shirt tomorrow to weed them out
How was the anime society you went to
You live outside London smh
Do you want your dva shirt back
It's the closest thing
Acc I have a loli police shirt
Or Tokyo ghoul shirt but it's prob too small for you
I just met Nile in a Christian choir formal of all places xd
He actually looked the most not belonging thanks to the kclms hoodie 😎
Hence Nile is a revolutionary
How tf do you remember his colour
Conditions don't apply
Help
I think I've built an immunity to alcohol after drinking 6 nights straight and getting fucked
Now I can't get drunk
I drank a lot last night tbf
Like almost a whole bottle of 20% liquor by myself
I wasn't that gud
You need a lot of age
Oh shit when did you turn 19???
Greeks are great
They have a great sense of humour and is super chill
~also takes care of me when I am drunk~
I was going to say
Nah there's just a lot of Greeks around me xd
If college marriage counts
You've already posted before
Let H,A,Ag,Og be a set 
For the reader
Ye
Ye
Wait lemme correct one thing about the theorem:
@447491084684 please correct it into a theorem
Already has examples in the proof
Ye you got it 100% xd
Big brain
Rip now the mystery is gone
Yeah hence the for all
~although Haytham supposedly disagrees~
You were the one who said this
You now know what me Haytham and Andres spent like a whole double free doing
It's a suitable substitution
😂😂😂
It was not this civilized
Yeah imagine a Spector approved theorem
Omg
There's a guy in my college
He looks exactly like Jed
And even knows Jed
Fkin insanity
He pees in his sink but he's still a great human being like Jed too
It's still gross
You're corrupting your sink with piss where you also brush your teeth
Imagine getting piss in your tooth
I've never seen someone that advanced
It's actually kinda disgusting actually a second year just randomly told me he came into my sink
No so
This guy who's in second year who used to use my room
He's like exactly me
In spirit I guess of saying dumb ass shit and doing dumb ass shit
He's basically more of my dad
No thanks
I don't and I won't
Who said this
There's no one from our year
Only Natalie from the year above
Yeah
Wait acc mb
Technically Abu is in Worcester but he's joining next year
Tbh it's been kinda meh
Most people basically never leave their college and also everyone stays in their room all the time so like people are only around in dinners
Lmao
Too much free alcohol xd
I drank like 7 days straight I think and like 4 of them heavy
Not to mention our principle gives us free wine just randomly in subject drinks
That's surprising
How has yours been ever since freshers
Wellllll
Oof
I has the impression that all of your lectures were like watching cartoons
Also is this cuz you've been procrastinating
Wtf
7
Ηοw thicc are each of em
Fuckk
That's insane
How many meths works sheet do you havr
Cuz atm I've only got like 1 sheet and it's ez
?
That's fine
Do you just have linearly increasing sheets?
Wtf
Only 3
That's fkin lucky
Alcohol
Wut
Wut wut
Oh shit nick you goof
Ye
Wait is that Japan only
Not sure
I don't really go to other Asian countries other than Japan
Huh
Why do they need 4
2 was already enough
It was enough that everyone was able to get meals off it
For frying ?
We had like an hour of lunch anyway
Also surely wattage doesn't matter
He did bring a watermelon once
Just not part of the Fruitman pallette
Gotta set things straight
Conclusion: it works fkin great
Needs lots of salad tho
Who?
I would buy but then that means I have to take it home
Dunno who it is
Chips worked great on their own
Oh OK
Wait that looks like colquhoun
I actually did the other day
To go climbing though
Yeah it tastes fkin awful
Maybe if it was soggy it would be nice
Hey the only "cooking" I can do is wraps :((
Well spotted
I got inspired by chips in a wrap to experiment with a bunch of different straps
We don't have a kitchen I mean
But they're like equivalent cars
Carbs*
It's too crunchy
Going to try some recursive wraps now like wrap in a wrap
Why is everyone going vegan
80% of my floor is vegan
I'm not giving up my fish and eggs and chicken
Me
Can I have some
Wtf how
My accommodation is literally 23.85/night and each meal approx 4.40/meal
And having to basically cheap out on innovative wraps
Is there a limit on max mass of food you bring?
Wat
Oh right ye
Who's kahoot
Wraps are the only things I can cook and I want to try something new every day
I'll post tommorow too nw
In December plox
How do you deal with a neighbour who is threatening you that they'll ejaculate in your kettle just to annoy you
Asking for a friend
How does this help
You gave me a new wrap idea
I think they would maybe not mind drinking their own semen in tea
After all some people drink their own semen
I don't want semen in my kettle to begin with '(
Holy shit
I found out today that my next door neighbour actually proved a theorem
And tattooed it onto his arm
He's also the same person trying to ejaculate into my kettle
He's fully published a paper too with proofs and colloaries
Wat
Oh maybe I just forgot cuz alcohol
Yeah but Mr ejacintokettleman actually proved it and published it
Which is like 8 tiers above just tattooing it
He's a fkin legend but also possibly more retarded than me
?
It's still smth to be proud about by engraining it to your body
He's literally writing another proof for some other problem Rn too + his proof got sourced in other proofs
Wtf
The fun thing is that Ioannis used the cup yesterday to drink the Malibu and milk so he probably couldn't distinguish between milk and semen
Unfortunately my room is somehow prone to everything that related
Bruh
Wtf
Wtf
Nick you impress me every fkin time
Nick you can prob make a career out of doing stunts
You gotta keep innovating
I'll stop with the gross ones
The pseudonym got busted by bence
I'll do one if you request a new content of a wrap
I'm staying to run out of ideas
I've even bought quorn to try new grounds
During freshers week but some people knew my name by Facebook already
I don't want nick's semen in my wrap
Also, i went to the go society here and wtf some people are so good they literally only gave me 8 land
I ate it like that tbh and it was quite a lot better then I thought
I'm so proud of you
Now you need to try all the carbs in a wrap
Yes
It's the best way to go
Relatable
I have 2 left of linear Algebra :(
Mood
You know a lecturer is great when they prove a result and then precedes to do it in a specific case
Like why
Is that chicken with it
Not enough chicken I feel
Yeah imagine that's when you know you've hit a low
It's a quorn and lettuce sandwich
I can't have any electronics other than kettle
How?
You'll have to buy it from all the tesco and 2x sainsburys
But no way of chopping it cuz no kitchen
I don't think you can do strew with kettle
Weird flex
This doesn't sound worth it
eating shit food /= flex
The only good ones have been scotch egg in a wrap
And chips ofc
They have cameras is the thing
Yeah but no way to cook the things I cut
Wtf 😂😅
No we can't
Cuz we're not allowed any cooking equipment other than kettles
Like we need to register all our electronics before we can use them and they reject toastie makers, microwaves etc
I used to cook soba noodles but now I ran out
But you need to put it in a wrap
Maybe xd
As long as its edible
Which this isn't
You just say that cuz I put lettuce in a lot of my wraps 😤
Appreciate the breakfast ides
But you would eat cereal and cookie
Wrap tastes neutral so it's fine
Anything is justifiable as long as you think hard enough
I'm only mixing low tier foods together
Sian
Since essentially I'm just making shitty wraps because hall is expensive
I only want to preserve the quality of higher tier foods I can mix low tier foods
I'm actually planning to this week so ye nw
That reminds me Miles's college wife literally cooks and cleans for him it's quite funny
It's only a tiny bit tbh since it's like £4.41 vs £3.00
How tho
Yeah he got college married
That's not how stats works but ye xd
Also you're assuming I won't be homeless
I mean it's not always the case that they cook and clean for you
E. G. Mine has vomited on me more times than she cooked for me
Homeless until when
Oof
Sure
~so, how much will you bail me out by and how much alcohol can I buy with it?~
See you in 7 years 28/10/2026
Doing maths to see the projectile of your pee and how that can launch missiles into the UK
It's like the buddy thing but the same year
Yeah I got married on the 2nd night of freshers week xd
Wait DM because I think @447491084684  will get too excited
She's half mandarin half Welsh
Also @447415299974 can I say what you did at fever
Ye ye
You're 100% going to say no
She does music
Oh wait I'm surprised
I thought you'd say anything non stem isn't
Sure
I'm surprised at how far you've changed
~Russian brainwash?~
Also the funny thing was when Bence tried to hit on my college wife in a club xd
Nah I didn't rlly care cuz that night was interesting with what bence was doing
The way he tried to hit on her was by saying: "hi I'm bence and I know your college husband but do you wanna dance" or smth like that
@447415299974 can you confirm
There's a guy who fucked like two French students and they're constantly trying to get on his lap to assert dominance
In my college
Idk about other colleges
Idk I've only seen Bence Evan Nahome consistently
Idk about others
^
Or like pictures of you guys in a kitchen
The weirdest thing though is when you see King's people in a club
I've tried vegan sausage role recently and it was actually nice
Woah you actually read the chat
I want to see you become one
As in once a week when I tell you to look at all the great wraps
I wanna at least see how long you can last being a vegan
Oof I didn't realize you were that drunk xd
Vegan challenge twitch livestream?
You guys are just uncultured swines
You'll have to come to ox and buy out all the wraps if you want to stop the wraps
But a sandwich isn't cursed
But he didn't curse my soul when I tweeted at him
Chips is a form of bread
Yes
I'll do this at some point
Basically the same
They're the same if you consider that they're both carbs
Writings CVs is the worst fkin shit ever
My linear Algebra tutor today forgot the quadratic formula which is questionable
I'm not that retarded
What do I eat that's worse than cardboard
Fkin hell you won't believe what Tal did today
He's my next door neighbour who has an equation he proved tattooed
I did leave bence and Tal together in a room multiple times for some time before so it's entirely possible
Lol that's cute
Tal is a legend but he also freaks me out on a Dailey
But I do actually recommend this
Yeah I mean I do need to eat them
Tbf it wasn't just you who suggested it
People in my college when I told them about project wrap
I'm also trying a triple carb wrap at some point where I put chips in a sandwich and then wrap that
What's wrong with triple carbs
I'll do it tommorow
I'll just slap some soy source on it or smth
Reminder that soy source is a liquid
But bence I haven't drank since the formal at Pembroke
❤️😍
You asked for it
This was out of my control I say everything nick says
Wat
Are you trying to figure out what numerical method they're talking about
:(
I can't warm it up unless I soak it on boiling water
Or smth retarded
I don't even have a microwave :(
Okay so
I'm actually going to cook in a few days because I'm going to borrow Univ kitchens
I'll show you guys how chef Ninoh does it
Wat
This is quite cool
Kinda surprised I'm third but then again I did make the group back in 2017
So if I dropped out, I can't do this anymore?
:(
Beans in wraps 😎
Ooo that does sound nice (if it wasn't for me not wanting my tea tasting starchy
I meant amino
I'm just stupid today cuz I'm ill
I guess
Are they part of the set A
What is that?
Nice
And the simulations apparently say we'll go 5km
Ye sure if I'm not too ill by then
I only eat wraps like once a day
And otherwise eat in hall or eat out
Rip
Also nick how did your scam into eth work Austin
Again*
Asking for a German speaking friend
Ye but apparently germans just like go to Swedish uni
Is there a difference.
?
Which one did you get into
Bachelor
I'm guessing
Nah they don't
From Germany im guessing is what you mean
Pass like a German test or just their respective country test
Ohhh I see
So you can get into eth by being a German speaker for Bach without much complications
Germany
Sure
Ty
It was moist
Because it had honey in it
You're moist
? Wdym
??????
I'll go on a 3 day break since I'm kinda ill again so I'll just eat in hall
But then I'll have to eat the core
Are you now implying I should do it xd
Can I contribute a recipe
You're the next coming of christ
Is that burger in chicken?
Yum
aiiii sik
currency trading in a weird way
Yee there is
No fkin clue
I didn't know who Joe Lee was who was apparently in the year above
No fkin clue
There's one in year above
Joe in the year above
I think it's a trend that 100% of Joe's get into Oxford
how do you deal with a man sexually attracted to number 3 constantly dancing in your room
asking for a friend
Yeah
He's sexually aroused by number 3
No but like he's actually turned on by the shape of 3
Not the concept of 3
"3 is kinda curvy and I like it"
I think the issue being that 8 is symmetrical
You're kinda gay
2 lines of symmetry vs 1
Also, a 3 is homeomorphic to a sphere whereas 8 is homeomorphic to a double torus
Manuj I miss your absurd logic
It's so bizzare
😂😂😂😂
Please let me know how he responds
we learnt it in the kcl lecture
the one where kings did an "open day" for the kcl uni
Yeah lol it was kinda interesting
Sorry I would but busy cuz I need to organise my room
I didn't for 3 days :(
Tbf
I have actually had okay wraps
I do
Just not this one cuz I was drunk yesterday and forgot to send
I mean I was so drunk I became a "prostitute" last night
Wut
The ham and cheese is nice
Wish I had salad but I ran out yesterday
Essentially we had a bop yesterday and I was wearing a bra and funky trousers
And I was a bit drunk and pretended to be someone's prostitute
Ai Ai sir
Btw this was actually just her posing xd
@447415299974 can confirm (kind of)
I mean her sister took the photo while laughing so
It's either her sister is sadistic or was OK
I would send a video of this happening so you see its clearly an act but it's slightly too cringe so I'll show you next time irl or smth
Gn
~alcohol and performance~
It was a bop night and the theme was walk of shame
Bop = bit of a party
Bop is the authentic pop 😤
What's circle
This is already assumed in our pres so we don't need a fancy name for it
When do you have it next
This is just what happens in any pre
I'm going hackathon that day now I can't
Wait what's pop
Wtf is that
Ik but none of them sound familiar
Uh do I?
According to someone here I am apparently
@447412888557

I fell asleep for the first time in a lecture today
Mainly because I did an all nighter but still
I'm proud I didn't sleep until now
So now I'm going to bed at 10:43
😎😎
Tbf its worth it I feel
Someone in the year above taught me a technique where you just do all your problem sheets in one day by doing an all nighter
For the week
So you can fuck about every other day
I've got like 2 q left to do but I've basically finished for the week
Ye ye it was cuz I was doing probability
~with caffeine overdose~ yes
I haven't looked over them all but I'm pretty sure I got like most of it right since most of the questions were show thats anyway
I mean this was also me yesterday
But after I finished all of them went like fk it and did this week's sheets

"if you have a hole in a proof, just stick a {LEMMA} in there"
Guys
I know this will be controversial
But I have a genuine recommendation
No
But it's so good
Genuinely maybe best wrap
No seriously it's like crepe in a wrap
It was good
I was in a room with yellow lighting.
Just wanna also say I wasn't the only one who said it was good I gave 2 medics a bite and they said it was good
If medics say its good you know its good
Tell them to feed the medic ice vodka with the ice cream
They look like chocolate chip cookies
That is not how you speak to a wrap god
😤😤
Oh
Bruh
I was half joking OK nvm
Can't be kicked off there no admin ez life ez strat
:(((
Okay give
I'll give back admin
I kinda like having all the media stored in one chat
Wut
That doesn't work
Without eyecontqct
Also I learnt how to wink now
You got fucked by the fuccboi
I can't look up
Yeah but I'm autistic
I'm also trying to finish problem sheets
And procrastinating
@447943649642 the highest chess rank player in Oxford is in Hertford
I just found out today and he's a cool guy
He offered to teach me but I don't think he would've been impressed at me xddd
I think he would be teaching you tbh
We have Microsoft giving a talk in our hackathon and they're trying so hard not to use google and use bing
And when they said "so hey! Everyone uses bing right!?!!"...... Oh god
Wtf our lecturer just said this too xd
Proof by double inclusion
I've just bought vegan eggs
I dunno how this will turn out
Don't know
"Can you use a wrap as a condom"
~Eito's theorem on the child?~
Btw I love these expressions now that I'm awake with chocolate 😂
It wasn't
You don't know them but Adrian
Not from jesus
But it's also a wrap at the same time
Also we had the best lecture today where our FP lecturer related bottoms to atomic bombs
Ye
Is it
It is*
What about ~七~
~nana~
What
He's beyond saving
Which pt
Aiii nice gud part despite lackluster characters
No xd
Ye ye but death 13 best
67!=66
This is so sad
Sorry boss
@447491084684 what do you think of soup in a wrap
Fuck no
I don't want more semen in my room
Implication by soggy biscuit
I'm not going to disagree with the highest iq person ik
I haven't actually sent her any wraps
But I think she'll just laugh tbh
~Nick Wong (2nd year biologist)~
Oh, I should clarify he owned my room before me, not anything else
Oh god so
We and my geek friend might get deaned for running around topless in a quad
Get called over to principal + fined I think
And like if you get deaned 2-3 times you're kicked
Well no cuz we were singing twinkle twinkle little star
In the quad topless while there were like posh guests
+ tried to naruto run away from the porter xd
~very~

You can hear the porter shout at the end too

Rip that moment when your King's eduroam finally expires ://
It's effort to set it up because you gotta like register stuff
Weird flex but OK
No this was his idea of flirting with Andrea
Hey its not me who's doing it xd
You say a lunatic but nothing compared to Tal
Also she buys me cookies so clearly she doesn't see issues 😤
Can I get one
This sounds like my interview question 😩 ptsd
Ik but I cba to use blender
Gray and neon green
Banana in a wrap
Thank you Haytham very cool
Someone in my college actually ordered alien hentai and it wasn't me
It was low tier sushi with low tier wrap
It's justified
I've also changed my thoughts which is that once high tier food is corrupted, it is corrupted for good
Yeah we have then here too
Idk what it's actually about
Nice wrap
Time to use my new password for every site
But then it makes no sense cuz we don't do chemistry
In what context?
And more alcoholic
😍😍
"if you understand monads, you can no longer explain monads to others"
Do you do java in your work experience

Neat
Yeah
Wtf was that
Bruh
I'm not sleeping tonight
I haven't started packing
I'm leaving in 5h so it's not good
I don't even know if I can fit everything in
We have to leave by 9am
Still up for strong and not even 1/3 done packing :(
Everyone here has gone to sleep because early leave tommorow
Me and my friend are the only ones awake in college I think
@447484284407 go to sleep
Wtf
Oh right I remember you said skiing
Are your parents picking you up at 5:00
Mb I'm just retarded
Didn't we say we'll raid @447868179280
Depending on which day is good for you Manuj
And then a simultaneous raid on Haytham
I don't think I'll go clubbing though because I've had enough yesterday for a while
Wait I just realized I'm not free on Tuesday 😢
I'm going to my college mum's birthday party
So uhh I'll probably join for Monday but not today
was Wilson the one you and Jack are in
I won't forget the man that actually got me alcohol
Nah
I remember there was that Asian guy who thought I was a brain dead but other than that no
He's had wine spilt on him once but other than that he's fine
This isn't OK
I mean someone in my college did actually fuck their mum
It was nick
What do you think about incest
Between siblings
Actually, maybe because I was her "prostitute" one night
Was this Jack
How have you never mentioned this individual
Woah
Interesting I have no clue
I think I only remember Jack because you sent me a picture of him
I'm indecisively up, depending on what internship I can land over the summer
If any
Yes but gil isn't real yet
Happy birthday Bhandari man 🎊🎉👍🎊🎉
Yo so are people going Hyde Park today or no
Rip
Ah OK just cuz transport is so fkin expensive now 😭
So I might go tomorrow before my mum's party to join the Manuj raid
Since his is super far
I was thinking of buying / reusing a bike to save on transport, but idk since I live so far
Ye I don't think I'll go today but tomorrow
Fuck
@447769118570 have you seen the new hs expansion and how broken it is
I'm genuinely considering buying pre release for £45
On this garbage game
Yeah but
It's so fkin broken
5 mana 4/6 heal 8
4 mana 2/5 draw + gain their deathrattle
2 mana ramp + draw a card
7 mana draw 4 increase hand size to 12
I can go on for longer but it's so fkin broken like no other expansion
Literally this set is going to dominate the next 3 expansions
@447868179280 what time can we come and raid?
I can only really do the afternoon, so When's the earliest?
I wanna say can I, but its a bit weird I guess
Oh also @447868179280 is heaven close to you cuz that's where we're going to be at night
But ye that aside, I'll try head there then, is it easier to meet at the department or your accommodation
Cool, I mean how close?
They're not lolis they're in high school
That means they're legal right
You're gay
Btw guys
Do we know for sure we can go mathsaganza?
Can someone email big Dan
^

If anyone gets this meme you've seen the dark side

Merry Manujmas19 🎊🎊🎉
To?
What is this
Does food + me = me wrapping it now
@447868179280 @447491084684 does Peter B Daddy ring a bell?
Rip I heard he's a legend maths lecturer at imperial
So much so people made a lo fi hip hop with his lecture recording
Not sure
They referred to him as Peter B Daddy and that's it
Merry chmas
War
Ye it's true
We had fried chicken yesterday
Aii see I can make stuff other than wraps
How is everyone doing for Christmas
I like the way the carrots are cut
Can't you see?
Vodka apple
Happy new year!! 🎉🎊🎊
New decade new goblets!!
Yo anyone want to climb at vaux east now/in 2-3 hours?
It's on the way back, I'd be down at like 8-9?
Oh nope it closes at 9 nvm xd
If you think about it
People who are vegetarian but not vegan are pro abortion
Because vegans don't kill eggs
Oh right I forgot eggs aren't fertilised
I don't think any vegan would go out of their way to kill the fetus
So I guess you can be both vegan and pro abortion
And test the solutions on python xd
Not sure
Where tf was that from
Guess
Is this the linear Algebra lecturer
Wut
I think all Russian guys ik are called Dmitry in some kind of way
Dmitry or Vladimir
This ^ for explanation
@447769118570 was Zurich in Sweden?
Cuz if so
I'll see you next Saturday xd
We're going on a homeless trip to Sweden
Did I just do a low iq move
I swear it was in Sweden
Nvm I'm retarded
Yeah I checked xd
No but its such a fucked plan xd
The plan is this guy called Mateja who's like Miles 2.0
He's going to hook up with someone in a club
And we stay at her/his house
Depending on who he hooks up with
Ye ye we doing this too
Exactly
So we're going to be homeless for 3 nights xd
2 acc I think
Will do
I think he said he's open for aany number
I think I agree
Gothenburg
Bought tickets too lmao
D:
Worst case can we rely on those people
Ehhhh
It's fine
I think we'll make it through
Sweden is relatively safe and we said one of us aren't going to drink for every night
We won't die so it's fine
Waow
Oh also @447415299974 don't tell other jesus people cuz we're doing this semi secretly
Is it not anymore?
UK is pretty dangerous tbf
Thank you I appreciate it
We also apparently got an accommodation because Mateja has got a date in Sweden booked
Although i think it's more like 40%
Mark you seemed to have a fun time yesterday xd
Rip
F
James Kluver
I haven't actually eaten a wrap yet in hillary
Ngl will dissapoint very soon
We have names for terms
2nd term is hillary
1,2,3
Our lecturer literally said: "You guys decide the answer to this question amongst yourselves by a democratic vote"
Try run repairs on your network adapter directly from device manager
Anyone know anyone in Sweden
Oh shit
Who do you know?
Are they near gothenburg
Lmao why
We're doing that tomorrow night
Makes sense
Ooooof
Oh wait that's walk nvm
We're on the plane but we somehow haven't died yet
Nah we doing that tommorow night
Also Sweden is so pretty and clean
+ Christmas illuminations
It was actually free
Fuck
I had the lowest iq moment ever
Fuck not having sleep and not having accommodation
Imagine going up to a baby and taking a picture of it thinking it was part of the fkin exhibition
Reee
Also @447769118570 scooters are fkin great
But then how am I going to pay to feed my scooter addiction
I have high luck stats
Nah we stayed in a pub and then didn't leave
Yes?
I'm actually sorta not free until 4 actually, but I'll see what I can do
Me 😭😢
I might be dunno tho
Happy birthday Reemon!!! 🎊🎊🎉
I'm interested but I might run out of money over Easter
Tfw you find out your tute partner for probability is imo silver medalist
Tf
I might regret this
Pasta in a kettle
I can't cook and I missed hall :(
So this is the only way I can eat
Rip
I feel like it'd crack
"traps aren't gay until you observe their penis because until then they're in a superposition of being both gay and not gay"
We're not allowed rice cookers
Cuz electricity regulations
?
My problem is more that scouts exist
And
Hall food is good enough first year
Scouts are cleaners
They come deep clean our room every week
LMAO
Maybe that'd work but eh I'm kinda broke atm xd
Guys, does everyone remember the name of the Little man computer website that was better
Than LMC
Nvm, I got it
Haha I'm feeling better
I'm on q5/7 so I think I'll sleep by 3 hopefully
Well
Haha I managed somehow
Wait link?
I thought he went back to framing
?
Oh
I see
Thank you everyone :D
You'll be here soon enough haha
Why Adrian? Xd
Ohhh yes I do remember
Ty ty
Does this have a specific meaning?
Imagine not being a teenager anymore
I'm just retarded nvm I thought 19 was not teen
Yes
Do you guys define it like
data Tsil a = Nil | Succ Tsil a
Or the other opposite Succ
List in reverse
Cuz it's right appended not left appended
Ye ye
Normal list is just [a]
I think
And then the best thing being foldables and monads 😭😭
Have you got to folding binary trees and stuff
Or like decomposing it
Yes 😭
I mean more generally any data type but the most interesting being a list
Ye but try do that in linear time complexity and then it becomes hell
Smh when circuit laundry bumps their prices to £1.70
Wash
Wtf
2.80
That's such a rip off
I feel like it's cheaper to just go down to Bath City and find a better laundry place
Yeah
Is wash + drying 1.60 for you guys
Yeah
Wtf lol
That's absurd
I can't imagine a wash being worth a triple ham and egg sandwich with Lupton ice tea and crisps
That's fucked
So is ours but like not £3
Bath xd
I actually have one
But after hearing that someone came in the bath tub I don't really want to take one
And last year someone had gay sex in it apparently
I think it's my particular staircase
Tbh
I mean I can take a bath it's just that I'll get stds
Ik that's not how stds work but shh
I like you too Haytham
I mean it's not just that but also coronavirus
Idk generally want to stay hygienic given that apparently that goes out of the window sometimes for me
Have you emailed Dr Kumon recently
What
How
Ask her if she'd take a bath with a Chinese person
Oh
No no I meqnt
Taking a bath in a bathtub that's mine
Cuz it's hella dodge
There's no guarantee it's not defiled yet tho
This
Tbf its not that bad
I just don't think about it most of the time
Same to you Haytham
Also anyone wanna come to Oxford on Wednesday for a 3 college intersection bop
You can never have enough magic mike
Cum
Absolutely
But I think my FP mark saved me
"pokemon is just slavery with a few more steps"
Fix
Fuck
Tfw you're about to fall

How are you sean
Sian *
What have your been up to
Mikey
I love your film the bottom of my heart
How are it
Got

Love it
It sounds like sian
You're so bad
As usual
Slim list
Lier
I'm ashamed to say baileys did this to me
😍 Daddy
If its Michael it doesn't count
Sub9 is too slow in this aggro meta
You usually never have enough time to play it
Also why double rat?
Similarly with dire frenzy so maybe replace those with like deadly shot or  albatross? Or extra secretkeepee
Oh
In that case put in like 2 copies of desert spear
That's like the best anti small boi weapon
Ye desert spear is best
If you have space albatross is really good btw
Solid 3 drop + ruins a lot of decks
Bad luck albatross
3 mana 4/3 deathrattle shuffle 2 useless albatross into your opponents deck
It fucks with highlander decks well + druids
Highlander?
:) ~I spend too much time on this game~
I think he's playing wild
No he's playing yog and kurtat defender
I swear it is
I think you just can't see the card text
That doesn't mean anything
I do
Yes
Shape is a bit dodge but it looks well done otherwise
9/10
@447415299974
That's cuz I haven't cooked them yet
Cuz we like cucumbers
Fkin great if you like thicc noodles
Nothing wrong with law students
We halved the workload
@447491084684 ask her what's her opinion on isekai reviewers
Also you should watch together
Black bean sauce with minced pork
And Lucy who's like my new new mum
We had to go 2nd year accommodation to go get a kitchen
Cumian and salt and pepper
No problem
Idk you'll see once night snack time begins
I forgot I have 2 deadlines tommorow 😭 so pulling my 5th all nighter this term
Is that actually how frequently you pull it
That's fkin insane
I die after 1 all nighter
I've had moments before where I almost attacked someone because I was so cranky due to no sleep
Fuckkkk
How
Do I tho
Night snacks are so fkin terrible
But also tastes fkin amazing
Some of them weren't that bad
Like chips e.g.
??
Why is he kahoot
makes sense
Tfw you learnt that the gold ioi medalist Bulgarian in Oxford is the biggest Weeb I've ever met
And he's got a good taste in anime
@447508201438 is anime a thing in Bulgaria
You can ignore them
Ye
hello
does anyone have an idea on whats the best representation for bracketing order
or smth like this
say for M1,M2,M3, M4,  the optimal is (M1x(M2xM3))xM4
how would you represent that bracket ordering, in say a list?
?
So how would you represent this kind of multiplication?
Nah ik how to do this
Ty
I think I get it
You'd do it like
Define K[j] to be the minimum time to multiply matrices
And then
Where j is the #of matrices you use up to
And then
You say K[j] = min(K[j-1]+ms[j-1]*ms[j], ms[j] *ms[j-1]*ms[j-2]
Soz I can prob explain better when I'm more sober
Ms being list of matrices
Being described as
The latter hiehjt of each mamyrix
Go chuck yourself
Dining
Rolls
Romania a
Yeah
Das right
Tanveer gets me
Nice
Ty this representation works I think
Wait, but how would you represent (M1xM2) x (M3xM4)
Oh shit
Ye that's prob it
Thanks
Ye
Tfw your tutor is a legend and he comes park end with our year
I love how he uses the same picture for everything xd
I'm not dw
Interesting way to put it
3b1b just called calculus "basically engineering"
Lol @447484284407 is that you?
Who lol
Woah where they from
Yeah
Late nighters?
@447508201438
I'm going to ask him if he knows a Bakalov
Also a guy called Abishek remembered you from when you were in Oxford
Nah when you were alone
He took the test of course that's the case
You need the newton's experimental law don't you?
That's the last bit that solves it
Using e = sep speed/appr speed
Nw xd
If that's 1 I think all that it tells you is that energy is conserved or smth like that
Like the ke is conserved between the two particles
Help
Does anyone know why
If you have f: [a, b] -> R, be convex, differentiable, strictly decreasing, with f(b) < 0
It should just be algebraic manipulation but I'm too dumb :((
yes
a lemma also tells you that statement is equivelant to
converge in this context means
if e_n is the error at nth step
(e_n+1)/(e_n) -> 1
as n -> inf
the magnitude anyway
you can assume there is a root between with intemediate value theorem and assuming continuity
what is?
I'd assume so but its hardcore analysis shit
wait wat
where does that come from
differentiating x_n+1 = x_n - f(x_n)/f'(x_n)?
there's a x_n term you forgot I think
ye
? how'd you know
um
how do you get to that? You're differentiating wrt x_n rite
rip
rip I mean you know there is a root between [x0,b), so you can show x1 > x0
but then showing that x1 is in [a,b) is unclear
f is strictly decreasing yeah
f(x0) >= 0, f(b) < 0 so thats why its between [x0,b) by intermediate value thm
oh and uniqueness I guess
but how do you know x_n+1 is always less than b
Rip
@447484284407
How?

??
exactly if corona gets so bad you can't go out you might as well get paid not to go out
On the link
People from our college is freaking out
over coronavirus apparently all spread through an opera group
how seriously are people taking the whole case?
Damn
@447902093934 when/how did that happen
But it gets worse exponentially
So it might be a gg wp
They ran out of tissues in most of North London too 😅
